<h1>The Data Science Process</h1>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the data science process that we follow. The focus here is on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA involves analysing and investigating data sets to understand their main characteristics. It helps data scientists gain insights, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and test early hypotheses. By employing data visualization methods, EDA provides a better understanding of data variables and their relationships.</p>

<p>The chart below shows a count of level 1 headings by year for D&amp;M phase projects.</p>
<p>The data suggests that the report changed format in 2009. It also suggests that there is a need to go back and clean the headings for data from 2009 as there are many level 2 headings mislabelled as level 1 headings.</p>

<p>In the modelling phase we extract the issues from projects within their D&amp;M phase between 2005 and 2008.</p>
<p>The chart below shows the number of headings by year for D&amp;M phase projects.</p>
<p>The data are mostly well formed. <strong>Some further cleaning to create uniform headers could be carried out</strong>.</p>
