The context does not provide specific information on what went less well and what can be improved in 2008.\"\n\n[[4]]\n[1] \"In 2009, the A400M project faced significant challenges. Airbus announced delays in the delivery date and a slowdown in the initial aircraft production rates. The first flight of the prototype aircraft, initially due in January 2008, was postponed until the second half of 2009. In December 2008, Airbus proposed a new approach to the A400M programme, which included revising the production schedule. However, full details of the revised schedule were still to be provided. Based on preliminary information, it was estimated that initial UK deliveries could not start before 2013. Despite these setbacks, there were positive developments, such as the roll-out of the first prototype aircraft at the Airbus Military Final Assembly Line Facility in Seville in June 2008 and the first flight of the specially developed TP-400D engine on the Flying Test Bed in late December 2008. By the end of March 2009, six flights of the Flying Test Bed had occurred.\"\n\n[[5]]\n[1] \"In 2010, the A400M project saw the first flight of the prototype in December 2009, and the continuation of flight trials in March 2010. However, the project faced challenges, with Airbus announcing in November 2008 that the first flight might not happen until the second half of 2009. In January 2009, Airbus proposed a new approach to the program and announced that they wished to discuss the program schedule and certain technical characteristics of the aircraft with customers. The UK and its partner nations agreed to a \\\"standstill\\\" agreement with Airbus Military to discuss possible options and outcomes for the A400M program. The renegotiation phase revealed that the A400M program would only remain viable with further investment from partner nations. The UK managed this additional funding through a reduction in the number of aircraft it receives. The principal factor for the delay to the program was its technical complexity, and poor management and control by Airbus Military. The program remained in a volatile and uncertain position while negotiations towards a revised contract continued. The Department planned to carry out a thorough review of the program later in 2010 when the revised program was established.\"\n\n[[6]]\n[1] \"In 2011, the A400M project, a collaborative programme involving seven European nations, was progressing towards its goal of providing tactical and strategic mobility to all three services. The design phase was nearing completion and manufacturing activities had begun. The first UK aircraft was expected to be delivered to the Royal Air Force in 2014.\\n\\nThe Strategic Defence and Security Review in October 2010 confirmed A400M as a component of the future RAF Air Transport Fleet. It also announced the earlier withdrawal of the Hercules C-130j Tactical Air Transport Aircraft from service in 2022 instead of 2030. \\n\\nIn March 2010, an agreement was reached to re-baseline the programme, setting the framework for contract amendment negotiations. These negotiations continued until November 2010, with the amended contract signed on 7 April 2011. As a result, the UK would receive 22 A400M, three less than originally expected.\\n\\nPositive achievements in 2011 included the addition of three more prototype aircraft to the flight trials fleet, which had amassed over 1404 flying hours by 27 March 2011. The A400M made its first visit to the UK, landing at its future main operating base RAF Brize Norton on 16 July 2010.\"\n\n[[7]]\n[1] \"In 2012, the A400M project made steady progress, with the revised aircraft production and delivery schedules remaining on track. Quarterly review meetings indicated that Airbus Military was making consistent progress. Investigation into engine problems encountered in 2011 concluded and solutions were developed, causing some disruption to the flight trials programme but not expected to significantly impact the aircraft production schedule. By the end of March 2012, all flight trials associated with the initial type certificate clearance, except for long distance endurance flying, were completed. The European Aviation Safety Agency granted a restricted type certificate in late April 2012. The first flight of the fifth and final prototype aircraft took place on 20 December 2011, and by 25 March 2012, the trials fleet had amassed 2944 flying hours and 1002 test flights.\"\n\n[[8]]\n[1] \"In 2013, the UK A400M Training Service achieved Main Gate Approval and will now be reported as a separate increment to the main A400M Programme. The original Main Gate Approval, which included elements of initial training and initial in-service support, was separated out and the A400M budgeted for and highest approved figures were adjusted to reflect this change. In anticipation of the achievement of UK A400M in Service Support Main Gate Approval later in the year, these elements of the original Main Gate Approval were also extracted. \\n\\nAt the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2012, it was announced that an order for the first UK A400M Full Flight Simulator had been agreed. On 4 March 2013, two further contracts relating to the A400M Programme were placed. The Training Service Support Contract will provide a specialist training school for personnel who will operate, support and maintain the A400M. A separate contract for the development, manufacture and installation of modifications required to operate the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures Defensive Aids System when flying in hostile environments has also been let. \\n\\nThe European Aviation Safety Agency granted a Full Type Certificate to A400M on 13 March 2013 after the conclusion of all of the required flight trials activity. \\n\\nThe progress of the project could be improved by avoiding delays and ensuring that all necessary approvals and contracts are in place in a timely manner. The project could also benefit from a more streamlined and efficient process for the development, manufacture and installation of necessary modifications.\"\n\n[[9]]\n[1] \"In 2014, the A400M project saw significant progress with the delivery of the first two A400M Atlas aircrafts to France, marking important milestones in the multinational aircraft production and delivery programme. The multinational flight trials programme had amassed over 6,000 flying hours by the end of March 2014, providing further evidence of the capability and design maturity of the new aircraft. The UK was set to receive two of its order of 22 A400M Atlas aircraft earlier than previously planned due to an exchange of two aircraft production slots with France. However, UK aircraft deliveries were still forecast to commence in the latter part of 2014. The A400M Schoolhouse at RAF Brize Norton was completed on schedule and accepted off contract on 28 March 2014. \\n\\nHowever, the A400M in Service Support Main Gate Business Case was still awaiting final endorsement and approval by Ministers and Her Majesty’s Treasury at the end of March 2014. Consequently, in Service Support was not reported as an increment in the year's report. Approval of the Business Case was anticipated early in the next financial year. \\n\\nFor improvement, the project could benefit from faster approval processes to ensure that all aspects of the project, including in Service Support, are included in the annual report.\"\n\n[[10]]\n[1] \"In 2015, progress for the A400M project included the delivery of the first UK aircraft, ZM400, to RAF Brize Norton in November 2014. The UK became the third partner nation to operate the A400M. The aircraft was officially named “City of Bristol” in a ceremony held in February 2015. The second RAF A400M aircraft, ZM402, arrived at RAF Brize Norton in February 2015. However, there were issues with the A400M programme and a revised baseline and delivery schedule was announced by the Airbus Group in February 2015. The UK revised its forecast of achievement of in service date from March to September 2015 due to these delays. The first A400M export customer, Malaysia, took delivery of MSN022 in March 2015.\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## How has the in-service date changed over time and what, if any, have been the operational
