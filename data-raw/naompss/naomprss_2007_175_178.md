Carrier Strike Senior Responsible Owner

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT

The requirement for the Future Aircraft Carrier (CVF) was endorsed in the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) which identified a continuing need for rapidly deployable forces with the reach and selfsufficiency to act independently of host-nation support. The SDR concluded that the ability to deploy offensive air power would be central to future force projection operations, with carriers able to operate the largest possible range of aircraft in the widest possible range of roles. The current Invincible Class of carriers was designed for Cold War anti-submarine warfare operations. With helicopters and a limited air-defence capability provided by a relatively small number of embarked Sea Harriers, it was judged that this capability would no longer meet future United Kingdom requirements. It was therefore decided to replace the Invincible Class with two larger and more capable aircraft carriers. CVF’s offensive air power will be provided primarily by the Future Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA). The Carrier Aircraft Group (CAG) will also operate the Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control (MASC) system together with helicopters from all three services in a variety of roles that include anti-submarine/anti-surface warfare, attack and support.

# SECTION 2: THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

Note: Actual in-service dates and costs are not set until projects reach the point in time when the main investment decision is made i.e. Main gate approval. Until this point all costs and dates are outline assumptions solely for internal planning purposes.

## 2a. Description of the Assessment Phase

CVF received Initial Gate approval in December 1998 and Invitations to Tender were issued in

January 1999. Following tender evaluation, competitive firm price contracts for the Assessment

Phase, each potentially worth some £30m, were awarded to BAE Systems and Thales UK in November 1999. Initially, the Assessment Phase was broken down into two stages. The first involved the examination of several carrier designs, and helped inform the decision in January 2001 to select the United States Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) as the option with best potential to meet the JCA requirement. Stage 1 completed in June 2001, following which proposals from the contractors for Stage 2 were considered, together with an assessment of their views on the level of work needed to adequately de-risk the programme. After careful consideration, the conclusion was reached that the original two-stage approach no longer offered value for money and the Assessment Phase strategy was changed.

The competitive second stage was revised and shortened (completing in November 2002) and enabled the competing contractors to concentrate on refining their designs and taking key trade-off decisions. An innovative Continuous Assessment (CA) process was used throughout to evaluate the contractors' performance which led to the conclusion that an alliance approach involving BAE Systems, Thales UK and the Department represented the best approach to CVF. The innovative Alliance procurement strategy will enable the full exploitation of the resources and strengths of the alliance participants with the shared objective of improving on agreed performance targets and was announced in January 2003. A third stage of assessment was therefore taken forward on this basis to further increase the maturity of the design and determine the alliancing strategy for CVF. Stage 3 completed in March 2004.

In July 2004, the Assessment Phase was extended into Stage 4 to further mature the design and carry out risk reduction work, to ensure that the best technical & procurement solution is achieved. Alliancing principles were agreed with BAE Systems and Thales UK and further developed with the selection in February 2005 of Kellogg, Brown & Root UK Ltd as an additional participant in the Alliance. The timescale for completing the design and risk reduction work was further extended in August 2005 (into Stage 5) although this did not result in any additional cost to the programme. The assessment phase completed end January 2006 at a revised total cost of £299m, following receipt of Cost Certificates from the alliance participants.

Following direction from the Investment Approvals Board (IAB), the project has adopted an incremental approach to Main Gate approval with the Demonstration and Manufacturing (D&M) phases being divided into two sequential Main Gate approval points. The first phase (demonstration), which included expanding the alliance to include Babcock Engineering Services and VT Shipbuilding, was approved by the IAB and Treasury in December 2005. The total cost of the demonstration phase (excluding Indirect Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit, but including non recoverable VAT) has been approved at £297m (not to exceed) and £254m (at 50% confidence). Expenditure to 31 March 2007 on the demonstration phase is £72m. The final main gate submission (which will include the costs of the demonstration phase) seeking approval to proceed with the manufacturing phase of the project is planned for mid 2007.

In March 2006, the UK agreed a Memorandum Of Understanding that provides for the supply to France of a common baseline design data pack to enable French industry to bid for the design, manufacture and support of one CVF (France). France has paid an initial entry fee and contributed to the costs of the UK demonstration phase.

<td colspan="3">The CVF is a key enabling component of carrier strike, capable of delivering the full level of offensive air effort, at medium scale, from the sea. The two CVFs will replace the current in-service Aircraft Carriers (CVS), HMSs Ark Royal and Illustrious, which have planned Out of Service Dates (OSDs) of 2012 and 2015 respectively. The decision to divide demonstration and manufacture into 2 sequential main approvals was taken to ensure that there is greater certainty on overall time and cost prior to committing to manufacture and to allow for coherency with the Defence Industrial Strategy. The IAB and Treasury approved the demonstration phase of the project in December 2005, and Main Gate approval for manufacturing is planned for mid 2007.</td>
