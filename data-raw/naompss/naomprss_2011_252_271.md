# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

Watchkeeper will provide the operational commander with a 24 hour, all weather, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance capability supplying accurate, timely and high quality imagery to support decision-making. The system consists of unmanned air vehicles, sensors, data links and ground control stations. Watchkeeper is planned to be delivered through an incremental programme to allow the system to benefit from both existing and emerging future sensors and air vehicle technology.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

Watchkeeper is a consolidation of the Sender and Spectator projects. Initial Gate approval was received for Sender in November 1999 and approval for a joint Assessment Phase for both projects was given in July 2000.

The acquisition strategy has been based on selecting Unmanned Air Vehicle systems to suit a defined capability requirement rather than an air vehicle-centred approach. Through evaluation and system concept demonstration, the Assessment Phase has driven down technical and schedule risks and derived the whole life costs associated with the proposed options. User and System Requirements were identified and revalidated. Trade-off activity was undertaken, taking full account of the impact across all Lines of Development and supported by balance-of-investment studies.

Alternative acquisition options have been considered. PFI was not deemed appropriate for the provision of a tactical capability deployed in theatre, due to the potential risks to contractor personnel and the required levels of availability as well as legal implications. Collaboration was explored during the early stages of the Assessment Phase, but it was not possible to align requirements. There is continuing dialogue with and between allied nations on matters of requirement definition, technology, operational experience and acquisition. The need for significant system integration with the emerging Network Enabled Capability requirements led the then Defence Procurement Agency and the potential contractors to adopt an incremental approach to delivery. This approach also supports the Force Readiness Cycle which provides for a phased uplift of capability at discrete intervals.

Opportunities to enhance Watchkeeper beyond the Full Operating Capability under further incremental acquisition have been considered during the Assessment Phase and will inform future investment decisions.

Following a competitive tendering process, Thales (UK) was announced as preferred bidder in July 2004. The programme completed the Assessment Phase of the acquisition cycle in July 2005, when Main Gate approval was given to proceed to the Demonstration and Manufacture phase.

# A.3 Progress

In July 2005, following an international competition, Thales (UK) was awarded prime contactor of the Watchkeeper Demonstration and Manufacture contract. Major project milestones completed to date include the System Design Review in December 2005, the Preliminary Design Review in July 2006 and the Critical Design Review of the air vehicle in December 2006. The System Critical Design Review was conducted in May 2007 and finalised in September 2007.

Watchkeeper’s maiden flight took place on 16 April 2008 in Israel and was followed by the successful achievement of the Automatic Take Off &
Landing System demonstration in July 2008.

1.  saw a number of key milestones including: Stage 2 flight trials concluded successfully in Israel in

March, the Watchkeeper Training facility at 32 Regiment Larkhill was commissioned in September, and the Automatic Take Off & Landing System initial maturity flights were concluded during Stage 3 flight trials in Israel in November.

However, towards the end of 2009 industry was struggling to resolve technical issues in the software development programme and was late with delivery of the necessary safety and airworthiness evidence in time to commence the UK's Stage IV flight trials test programme at Parc Aberporth in South Wales. The trials programme, therefore, started six months behind the planned schedule. MOD expressed its reservations that the programme was at risk to Thales (UK) numerous times but industry maintained that it could deliver Watchkeeper on time. The first UK flight took place on 14 April 2010, signalling the start of the UK flight trials programme. Flight trials also continued in parallel in Israel during 2010 to reduce risk by providing additional system and software testing.

1.  started on a positive note with the Watchkeeper Initial Contractor Logistic Support contract signed in January and also saw the Watchkeeper Training solution continue to develop. In June 2010, a contract was awarded to QinetiQ, through the exploitation of the Long Term Partnering Agreement, to deliver Steady State UK training facilities, infrastructure and airspace at Boscombe Down for Watchkeeper. This contract minimises capital investment costs, maximises airfield operational flexibility as the runway at Boscombe Down already exists and is the correct length and width and is situated in the Restricted Airspace. The Facility was handed over to MOD in December 2010.

However, the challenging development programme was by now also experiencing severe technical integration issues in the following areas: most critically completion of the Client-Server software (the core software

^Enter\ Text\ Here^providing all mission functionality) Development and Integration, Automatic Take Off & Landing System and the De-icing System. Thales declared that it was unable to meet the main equipment delivery Anchor Milestone of June 2010 (50% date), and forecast a revised delivery schedule reflected in the current delivery dates. The MOD Project Team has since continued working closely with Thales (UK) to understand the causes of the problems and implement an agreed revised schedule and project plan. Contract negotiations to account for the technical issues and optimise delivery of the system for deployment to Afghanistan have now concluded; MOD has reached a settlement to remedy the situation and mitigate risk to operations at no further cost. An Information Note informed the Investment Approvals Board of the situation in October 2010. A Review Note was subsequently submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in March 2011 to endorse the accepted position and to approve the revised project schedule, which "reset" the In-Service Date. Despite this setback Thales (UK) has confirmed its commitment to delivering Watchkeeper and continues to work closely with the MOD project team and end Users.

Under the revised programme, considerable additional resources and facilities have been deployed by Thales (UK) to maintain the new schedule timescales and minimise risk. An intensive programme of software development, "bug" fixing and integration of the final version of software finished during 2010, which resulted in a successful Trials Readiness Review and Functional Qualification Testing in March 2011. This version of the software will now be extensively trialled and tested at Parc Aberporth and Boscombe Down in the Stage V flight trials against mission specific scenarios to allow the Watchkeeper system to be deployed to Afghanistan. Delivery of the necessary production standard equipment has remained on track, albeit with some technical risk, and Thales (UK) has agreed to deliver additional equipment required for deployment of Watchkeeper to Operation Herrick.

A number of specific modifications to make the Watchkeeper System compatible with current operations are also required; these are not shortfalls in the Watchkeeper specification but theatre-specific modifications not in the Watchkeeper technical specification. For example, to make the imagery produced by Watchkeeper’s sensors compatible with the existing Remote Viewing Terminals used in Operation Herrick, operational equipment specific to Watchkeeper was required and was contracted for in June 2010. Furthermore, to reduce risk to operational deployment and ensure the revised programme timescales were maintained, some of the more complex software functionality unessential for initial operational deployment has also been deferred and is planned to be delivered in the next formal software release in 2012 at no additional cost to

MOD.

# A.4 Capability Risks

Watchkeeper replaces the capability previously provided by Phoenix Unmanned Air Vehicle which reached it’s Out of Service Date in April 2008. The Hermes 450 (known as Lydian) Unmanned Air Vehicle has been contracted on a service-based provision to provide continued capability and cover an Urgent Operational Requirement in Iraq and Afghanistan prior to Watchkeeper being delivered into service this has subsequently moved to an Urgent Operational Requirement in Afghanistan. If the capability is not acquired, UK forces in Multi-National Division (South East) will face a critical shortfall in the provision of formation-level persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance.

The aim of the Watchkeeper Support Solution is to put in place through-life maintenance and support to sustain the Watchkeeper Military Capability on deployed operations and to meet the training requirement. The Watchkeeper military capability is delivered through a combination of MOD manpower and equipment, operating in conjunction with equipment and software provided by Industry. The scope of the support solution covers both the equipment from Thales (UK), the Prime Integrator, and the Government Furnished Assets. The scope of the Thales (UK) support will be detailed in the associated support contract whilst the scope of the Government Furnished Assets support will be defined in a series of Internal Business Agreements with the relevant project delivery teams. The through life strategy focuses on two phases:
Phase I - The first three Years – 2011-2014. Phase II - The follow on contract (2014 onwards) will be based on an approval strategy that will provide a robust concept of analysis, Investment Appraisal and Business Case all based on sound performance data collected in Phase I. Because the Watchkeeper Demonstration Manufacture and Initial Support contract finishes as this contract is set up it will be important to ensure that Phase II can support Watchkeeper in terms of capital and resource. Phase II is most likely to be competed.

<td>Testing and evaluation of the contractor deliverable system is at risk for a number of reasons, but the current phase of trials is due for completion on schedule. The contributing risks include recent activities in Israel and resources dedicated to test and evaluation by sub contractors not being as they should to ensure delivery of scheduled test and evaluation. Issues are further compounded by the maturity of the client server software (which impacts upon test and evaluation). Trials mitigation strategy is under review. Mitigation action for the software was taken as part of the overall De-risking Initial Operating Capability package. Technical maturity has been further compounded by the immaturity of both the client server software (which also impacts upon test and evaluation) and the Automatic Take Off and Landing System. The start of the trials programme in the UK has been impacted by the lack of safety and airworthiness evidence presented by Thales. A trials mitigation strategy, aimed at recovering the situation is under review.</td>

<td>The requirement to disseminate the Watchkeeper product across the battlespace has grown beyond the capacity of Bowman. There is now a need to inter-operate with the deployed UK Core network (Defence Information Infrastructure Future Deployed, Defence Information Infrastructure Current Deployed, Falcon, Cormorant, Reacher) to allow exploitation via the Dabinett programme and Urgent Operational Requirements that will provide early capability such as Attacker. This is put at risk by dependency on other programmes as well as a required change to the Watchkeeper approach to exchange of information. The need to ensure that Watchkeeper Full Motion Video will be accessible by Remote Video Terminal users is being addressed by a Planning Round enhancement option to achieve initial delivery by July 2011.</td>
