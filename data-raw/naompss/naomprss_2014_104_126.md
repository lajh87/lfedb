# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Joint Combat Aircraft is the requirement for a multi-role aircraft to be operated jointly by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy from both fixed and deployable land bases and the new Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers.

The Joint Strike Fighter (F-35 Lightning II) was selected as the aircraft to meet the Joint Combat Aircraft requirement, and provides the UK with a fifth generation air system. Lightning II provides the UK with an expeditionary multi-role combat aircraft with the ability to enter and operate within contested airspace. Lightning II is a stealth aircraft which includes an array of advanced sensors, highly integrated mission systems and is equipped with air to air and air to ground weaponry. It is capable of undertaking a wide range of operations from land bases and the Queen Elizabeth Class Carriers (QECC).

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

Approval was obtained in November 1996 to enter the Concept Demonstration Phase on the Joint Strike Fighter programme under a Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 1995. The phase began in November 1996 with two competing United States Prime Contractors (Boeing and Lockheed Martin) designing and flying demonstration aircraft on which the selection of the preferred bidder was based. The phase completed in October 2001 with the announcement of Lockheed Martin as the successful bidder.

## A.3. Project History

The project has followed an incremental acquisition strategy from its conception. A Main Gate approval

(Main Gate 1) was obtained in January 2001 for participation in the System Development and

Demonstration (SDD) phase of the Joint Strike Fighter programme, leading to signature that same month by UK and United States governments of the SDD Memorandum of Understanding. The UK is the only Level 1 Partner Nation within the SDD programme, along with the United States Services, and is able to decide and agree the Requirements within the JSF Contract Specification, which delivers the Block 3 capability required by the UK at initial operating capability.

The selection of Lockheed Martin as the Joint Strike Fighter and Air System prime contractor included a teaming agreement with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to collectively form Team Joint Strike Fighter. Two separate and competitive propulsion contracts were awarded to Pratt and Whitney for the F135 engine and General Electric/Rolls Royce Fighter Engine Team for the F136 engine. In April 2011, the F135 engine was selected as the sole engine variant within the Joint Strike Fighter programme.

In September 2002 the UK selected the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) Joint Strike Fighter variant to meet the Joint Combat Aircraft requirement. A review of the Joint Strike Fighter Programme, and the viability of the STOVL design was completed in January 2005 post a period of anticipated contract non-compliance. It concluded that a successful programme of weight reduction initiatives and other performance enhancements had restored confidence in the STOVL design, which should remain the UK’s preferred solution to meet the JCA requirement. A further review by the Investment Approvals Board in July 2006 confirmed this decision.

On 12 December 2006 Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support signed the Production

Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding, which coincided with Main Gate 2 approval. This MoU committed the UK to a collaborative partnership with 8 other international partners.

In March 2009, approval (Main Gate 3) was given for the participation in joint Initial Operational Test & Evaluation with the United States Services. This Main Gate procured 3 Operational Test aircraft.

In October 2010 the UK Government's Strategic Defence & Security Review announced that the Joint Combat Aircraft programme would switch variant from the STOVL variant (F-35B) to the Carrier Variant (F-35C).

In May 2012 the UK Government reverted back to the Joint Strike Fighter F-35B variant due to the increased cost, technical risk and programme delay associated with converting the Queen Elizabeth Class carriers to receive the Joint Strike Fighter Carrier Variant.

On 19 July 2012, the UK took delivery of its first Joint Strike Fighter aircraft at Lockheed Martin's Fort Worth facility in Texas USA, which commenced flying operations at Eglin Air Force Base later that year.

## A.4. In-Year Progress

The UK took delivery of its third F-35B aircraft (BK-3), which transferred to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on 25 June 2013. BK-3 joined the US Marine Corps’ Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501 (VMFAT 501) to support core pilot and maintainer training. An order was placed for a fourth UK F-35B aircraft in September 2013.

The Lightning II Main Gate 4 Business Case (MG4 BC) was endorsed by the Investment Approvals

Committee (IAC) in October 2013 and obtained HM Treasury approval in January 2014. The Lightning II MG4 BC sought approval to procure the aircraft for the first UK Squadron with all associated support equipment and capital spares. The Business Case also approved the procurement of Freedom of Action (FoA) facilities, and all associated support contracts, which will enable the transition of the aircraft from the US to the UK, delivery of Initial Operating Capability from RAF Marham in December 2018, and permit initial First of Class Flying Trials to take place aboard the new Queen Elizabeth Class Carrier in the same year. The MG4 BC approval provides for the support contracts to cover the period 2015 to 2020.

Main Gate 4 set the operational In Service Date (ISD) for the UK Lightning II aircraft as 31 December 2018.

During the MPR14 reporting period, the first three British operational pilots completed their training to enable them to fly the F-35 and are now flying regularly from Eglin AFB, FL.

## A.5. Capability Risks

The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010 confirmed the need for Joint Strike Fighter which forms the backbone of Carrier Enabled Power Projection. If the UK did not acquire Joint Strike Fighter it would be unable to meet its Combat Air and Carrier Enabled Power Projection requirements and be unable to support ground forces in multi threat environments at a time and place of the Government’s choosing.

Joint Strike Fighter brings no significant risks to other projects, but relies heavily on the Queen Elizabeth Class Carrier programme to deliver suitable carriers to introduce a Carrier Strike capability around 2020.
