# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
The requirement for future integrated air defence includes ground based command and control, surveillance and weapons. This is a Defence capability priority, driven by the need to counter the future air threat. This will evolve from current aircraft (fixed wing and helicopters) to also include cruise missiles, unmanned air vehicles, rockets, artillery and mortars. The latter are described as difficult air targets. Network Enabled Airspace Defence and Surveillance is a large and complex incremental acquisition programme, currently in Assessment Phase for Increment 1. The programme will address the capability gap described above by providing a capability to compile and distribute a timely and accurate air picture, conduct airspace management to allow safe operations and defeat the air threat throughout the Land environment area of operations. The three increments are as follows:-
Increment 1 Increment 1 will replace Urgent Operational Requirement equipment with an enduring Counter Rocket Artillery &amp; Mortar automated sense and warn capability from 2015. This capability is being used in Afghanistan to protect UK bases from rocket artillery and mortar attack. This was provided under Treasury Urgent Operation Requirement Funding. Automatic Sense and Warn capabilities will be brought into the core equipment programme. Increment 2 Increment 2 will deliver an initial Counter-Unmanned Air Vehicle Capability and replace the existing Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar intercept capability from 2017 as well as sustain ground-based air defence in the Falkland Islands beyond 2020. Increment 3 Increment 3 will improve protection against the remainder of the Difficult Air Targets with Full Operating Capability expected in 2027. The Difficult Air Targets set includes cruise missiles, Unmanned Air Vehicles, Attack Helicopters and

# A.2 Assessment Phase History

<tr>
<th>
Approval for the Assessment Phase 1 was given by the MOD Investment Approvals Board in February 2010, and ratified in June 2010 as part of the review by the new coalition Government. The objective of the Assessment Phase 1 is to establish the most cost effective solution to the Increment 1 requirement and early de-risking activities for Increment 2. The current approval covers Assessment Phase work required to reach Main Gate 1, which leads to the Demonstration and Manufacture phase for Increment 1 and effectively Increment 2 Initial Gate. The Assessment Phase has been structured into three workstreams as follows:

<ol type="a">
<li>Workstream 0. Initial de-risking activities will identify and address any changes and further lessons learnt as a result of the evolving Land Environment Air Picture Provision and Urgent Operational</li>
</ol>

Requirement projects and current operations. Further work will develop the architecture required to allow the incremental insertion of capability over the project lifecycle. This will also drive coherence into future Urgent Operational Requirement activity and address any scaling issues as a result of the Defence Review.

<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Workstream 1. The work stream will result in the down selection to a single affordable option to be presented at Network Enabled Airspace Defence and Surveillance Main Gate 1 to deliver the Automated Sense and Warn capability. A full option analysis will be undertaken to investigate retaining extant Urgent Operational Requirement and Core Programme components as well as alternative off the shelf solutions.</li>
<li>Workstream 2. This work stream will result in the development of a detailed system architecture and associated systems and technical requirements and initial evaluation of potential equipment options. It is planned to de-risk the overall Network Enabled Airspace Defence and Surveillance architecture, by integrating Future Local Area Air Defence Systems (Land) and High Velocity Missile models/ equipments into a representative Network Enabled Airspace Defence and Surveillance system and also undertake an initial assessment of Counter-Rocket Artillery and Mortars effectors.</li>
</ol>

In 2010, associated with the Strategic Defence and Security Review a number of options were raised to

An Industry Day was held in November 2010, at which a number of companies were briefed on the programme. Since then industry have been kept informed of developments via a series of newsletters. A series of one to one discussions with industry on Increment 1 is currently being conducted, following the Request for Information for Increment 1.

# A.3 In-Year Progress

As at 31 March 2012 the project is moving steadily forward to a Main Gate submission in \\\. It has been delayed primarily due to the MOD wide Comprehensive Commitment Control Regime. This delayed the start of several key tasks by ten months.

Good progress has been made however, refining the Network Enabled Air Defence and Surveillance Increment 1 requirement, and starting the operational analysis to provide much of the underlying justification for the Main Gate submission.

Engagement with industry continues, with a series of one to one discussions with those companies who have expressed an interest in Increment 1 work.

# A.4 Capability Risks

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
Successive Capability Audits have confirmed the threat of Difficult Air Targets to the Land Environment (including the littoral) and in particular from rockets, artillery and mortars and unmanned air vehicles. The UK has already encountered the Rockets, Artillery and Mortar threat on current operations and it is highly likely that the threat to Land forces will become more sophisticated and challenging over time. Network Enabled Airspace Defence and Surveillance will counter the Difficult Air Targets set with a mix of sensors, command, control, communications and shared situational awareness and, where necessary, effectors. Delivery is aligned to Defence Priorities of countering Rockets, Artillery, Mortar and unmanned air vehicles and then the remaining threats as well as maintaining the Ground Based Air Defence commitment to the Falkland Islands. Network Enabled Airspace Defence and Surveillance will enhance Multi-National and Joint integrated and layered Air Surveillance and Defence throughout and contributes to Joint Fires Integration and Airspace Management. The March 2012 Single Statement of Need states that ‘as an integrated element of the Joint force, the User must be able to compile and distribute a timely and accurate air picture, conduct airspace management and defeat the air threat throughout the Land area of operations.’
Increment 1 will replace existing Counter Rocket Artillery &amp;
Mortar Automated Sense and Warn Urgent Operational Requirement equipment with a counter rockets, artillery and mortars enduring capability from 2016. This capability is currently being used in Afghanistan to protect UK bases from rocket artillery and mortar attack. This was provided under Treasury Urgent Operational Requirement funding. Automatic Sense and Warn capabilities will be brought into the core equipment programme. Not taking Network Enabled Airspace Defence and Surveillance to Main Gate would delay the implementation of a core Automatic Sense and Warn capability, potentially increasing reliance on the Reserve for additional Urgent Operational Requirement activity to maintain support in Theatre.

Where possible existing support equipment, facilities and practices will be used to minimise the cost of introducing Network Enabled Airspace Defence and Surveillance into service. This will be achieved by applying Integrated Logistics Support techniques during the incremental acquisition, three Increment approach. The developed support solution(s) will be cognisant of those support solutions that are already in place for in-service equipment as well as the Counter Rockets Artillery and Mortar, Automatic Sense and Warn Urgent Operational Requirement and the incoming Land Equipment Air Picture Provision equipment. The aim will be to minimise and, where possible, use existing support assets and facilities in order to reduce the logistic burden and provide a coherent support solution for the Network Enabled Airspace Defence and Surveillance programme through life.
