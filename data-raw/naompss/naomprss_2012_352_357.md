CORE PRODUCTION CAPABILITY

# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

To maintain a naval reactor Core Production Capability (CPC) to support the UK’s nuclear submarine flotilla. All Royal Navy submarine propulsion nuclear reactor cores have been manufactured at the RollsRoyce (RR) Raynesway site.

To conduct nuclear operations on the Raynesway Site, Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations Limited is ‘Licensed’ formally by the Health and Safety Executive (Nuclear Department) (HSE(ND)) as required by the Nuclear Installations Act.

The technological and manufacturing capability to produce submarine reactor cores has traditionally been sustained through successive contracts for their production. With the introduction of long life cores and the reduction in the submarine flotilla size the numerical requirement for cores has reduced.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) White Paper deferred the In-Service Date (ISD) for the Successor SSBN to 2028 with a 36 month drumbeat.

# A.2 Assessment Phase History

In September 2007, the Investment Appraisals Board approved the Core Production Capability Initial Gate Business Case, to down select to the phased regeneration of the Rolls-Royce Raynesway Site, as the most cost effective way of delivering the capability.

The Assessment Phase contract was let on 13th February 2008. The contract covers Assessment Phase work up to February 2010.

Interim Contract placed on 4th February 2010 to cover work required to complete Assessment Phase activities.

# A.3 In-Year Progress

Support continued with Assessment Phase related work throughout the year, with work completed including:

1.  2 years operation and maintenance of the current facilities. This is essential to ensure that the Nuclear Site License is maintained.

2.  Maturing the design of the manfacturing facility and equipment. This work is essential to allow construction to start as planned to support the programme.

3.  Enabling works complete - Fencing and new security gates etc. This is part of the work on the Nuclear Licensed Site boundary to maintain security requirements and to provide site access for future regeneration works on the site.

4.  Significant value engineering undertaken and developed. The work has continued the value for money exercises, with regard to the design of the Manufacturing Facility and Product Assembly Building .

Main Phase Contract negotiations commenced in June 2011.

CORE PRODUCTION CAPABILITY

# A.4 Capability Risks

Cancellation of the CPC project means that there would be no nuclear reactor cores for the Successor Programme or any future nuclear submarine programme.

Delivery of the CPC project is essential in order to manufacture reactor cores for the submarine programme, support development work on the Successor core design and manufacturing processes and maintain the site Nuclear Licence and essential manufacturing and engineering skills, that would require significant time and cost to recover and therefore represent an intolerable risk to the Successor Deterrent core production schedule and subsequent in-service date.
