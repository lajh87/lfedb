A Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

A400M is planned to provide tactical and strategic mobility to all three Services. The required capabilities include: operations from airfields and semi-prepared rough landing areas in extreme climates and all weather conditions by day and night; carrying a variety of equipment including vehicles and troops over extended ranges; air dropping paratroops and equipment; and being unloaded with the minimum of ground handling equipment. The Strategic Defence Review confirmed a requirement for an airlift capability to move large single items such as attack helicopters and some Royal Engineers’ equipment and concluded that this would be met, in the latter part of this decade, by Future Transport Aircraft. The A400M was selected to meet this requirement. It will replace the remaining Hercules C-130K fleet.

A400M is a collaborative programme involving seven European nations (Belgium, France Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and United Kingdom). A total of 180 aircraft (25 for UK) are being procured through a contract with Airbus Military Sociedad Limitada. The design phase is nearing completion and manufacture activities have commenced. First Flight is now expected in Financial Year 2009-2010 and delivery of the first UK aircraft to the Royal Air Force in Financial Year 2014-2015.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The Government announced in December 1994 that it would replace its ageing C-130K Hercules fleet, in part by procuring 25 C-130J’s from Lockheed Martin and in addition, subject to certain conditions, by rejoining the next phase of the collaborative Future Large Aircraft programme (now known as A400M). The Future Large Aircraft ‘Initial Gate’
approval was achieved in July 1997 and in the same year the solution assumed for costing purposes was changed to an initial lease of four C-17 and subsequent procurement of 25 Future Large Aircraft. A Request For Proposals was issued to Airbus in September

1997 on behalf of the seven Future Large Aircraft nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain,

Turkey, UK). Subsequently, in July 1998, four nations (Belgium, France, Spain, UK) issued a

“competitive Request For Proposals” for a Future Transport Aircraft to Airbus Military Company (A400M), Boeing (C-17) and Lockheed Martin (C-130J).

Proposals were received on 29 January 1999 and parallel national and international assessments were undertaken. These covered Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisal, technical and commercial compliance, risk assessment, and an appraisal of the international and industrial dimensions. This work also led to parallel negotiations and clarification with the three bidders. At the direction of the

Equipment Approvals Committee in December 1999, additional work was undertaken to inform the Main Gate submission. On 16 May 2000 the Government announced the decision to procure 25 A400M aircraft to meet the Future Transport Aircraft requirement.

## A.3. Progress

The past year has been very challenging for the programme, with Airbus announcing slips to the delivery date and a slow down in initial aircraft production rates. Airbus also announced that the first flight of the prototype aircraft, due in January 2008, may not now happen until the second half of 2009. In December 2008 Airbus proposed a “new approach” to the A400M programme, including revising the production schedule. Full details of the revised schedule are still to be provided by Airbus but, based on preliminary information, it is estimated that initial UK deliveries cannot start before 2013. Positive achievements have been the roll-out of the first prototype aircraft at the Airbus Military Final Assembly Line facility in Seville in June 2008 and the first flight of the specially developed TP-400D engine on the Flying Test Bed in late December 2008. By the end of March 2009 six flights of the Flying Test Bed had occurred.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Not proceeding with this capability would significantly reduce the UK’s net tactical air transport capability due to having to rely solely on C130J aircraft to provide support to operations after the C130K aircraft Out of Service Date in 2012. Without mitigation, this would introduce additional risk to the C130J due to increased fatigue of the fleet. Alternatives are being investigated. The options being explored include:
extension to the existing C130K aircraft, purchasing more C17 aircraft, A330 Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft being brought forward or hiring commercial aircraft. Deputy Chief of The Defence Staff (Equipment Capability) is tasked with leading on this work.
