# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

The requirement for the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme is to sustain the capability of the Armoured Infantry within the balanced force against current and emerging threats, across the spectrum of conflict until the Warrior Out of Service Date. The Warrior Armoured Fighting Vehicle was brought into service in 1988 with an Out of Service Date of 2025.

The Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme consists of four main elements:

1\. Warrior Fightability Lethality Improvement Programme

(A new turret incorporating a fully stabilised automatic 40mm cannon)

The 40 mm Cased Telescopic Cannon and Ammunition System has been mandated as the weapon system for Warrior and procured by a joint Anglo-French project. The project is currently part way through qualification of the ammunition and cannon, concurrently the weapon system is being integrated into Warrior by Lockheed Martin UK, who will qualify the new turret.

1.  Enhanced Electronic Architecture

(Power generation and distribution enhancement and the introduction of a modern electronic architecture)

1.  Modular Protection System

(Applique Armour fixing points, enabling a 'tailored' armour solution to counter specific threats)

1.  Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle

(A new variant, replacing obsolescent platforms, that has equal protection and mobility to the core fighting platforms). Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle is currently in the Concept Phase and is subject to future approval.

The current affordable fleet is 565 vehicles including 445 currently planned to be upgraded to Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme which includes the intent to upgrade 65 to Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Assessment Phase was conducted from the approval of Initial Gate (27th July 2009) to the contract effective date of 31st October 2011. A competition was run, with two bidders (BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin) invited to compete.

After Initial Gate, the programme was given a compressed timeline of six months to gain Main Gate

Approval, and a Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approval Board in February 2010. Affordability issues due to an over extended Defence Budget meant Main Gate Approval was not given, with the bidders requested to Revise and Confirm their bids against a range of options. In March 2010 the Investment Approvals Board approved an uplift of up to £12.4m to fund the extended Assessment Phase.

The programme team resubmitted a Main Gate Business Case to the Defence Equipment and Support Investment Board on 11th July 2011, which was approved and submitted for the Investment and Approval Committee meeting on 19th July 2011. Approval was given by Her Majesty's Treasury on 4th October 2011 and then the Investment and Approvals Committee on 10th October 2011.

The Prime Minister visited the Lockheed Martin facility in Ampthill, Bedfordshire on 25th October 2011 and made a public announcement regarding the placement of the contract with Lockheed Martin.

The Contract for the Demonstration Phase was signed on 31st October 2011.

Within the Warrior approval, the 40mm Cannon was the mandated weapon system (March 2008) which would enable commonality with the Specialist Vehicles Programme, thus benefiting from common ammunition and training. A Review Note for the 40mm Cannon went to the Investment Approvals Board in March 2010 and was approved in April 2010.

# A.3 Project History

25th August 2010 - Revise and Confirm bids received from bidders

4th October 2011 - Formal Approval from Her Majesty's Treasury

10th October 2011 - Formal Approval from Investment Approvals Committee

25th October 2011 - Ministerial Announcement by Prime Minister

31st October 2011 - Contract Effective Date with Lockheed Martin UK

MAIN WEAPON SELECTION - SCOUT: Approval for the selection of the 40mm Case Telescope

Weapon System was given in 2008 to enable commonality with the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme, thus taking the benefit of common ammunition and training. Qualification for the 40mm Case Telescoped Weapon System is led by the Scout - Specialist Vehicles team.

# A.4 In-year Progress

The following milestones have been achieved by Lockheed Martin in-year::

April 2012 - Integrated Baseline Review {Performance Measurement Baseline functioning, Programme Planning artefacts established and integrated and Corrective action plans developed and accepted at the completion of the Integrated Baseline Review}

May 2012 - System Design Review (Anchor) {Conduct FV510 & FV511 System Design Review in accordance with and meet the criteria in the Systems Engineering Management Plan, Demonstration and collection of evidence of operation in live fire and trundling environments in accordance with the subject Test Plans, covering: Primary & Secondary Sighting Systems; Fire Control System (FCS) and Develop and agree corrective action plans for this Anchor Milestone’s acceptance criteria, as appropriate, at the completion of this Design / Readiness Review.}

September 2012 - Ballistic Solution Algorithm Software Drop 3
{Ballistic Solution Algorithm Interface

Control Document for Software Drop 3 approved and Fire Control Algorithms Sub-Systems Requirements Document approved}

November 2012 - System Architecture Design Review 510/511 (SADR) (Anchor) {Conduct FV510 &

FV511 System Architecture Design Review in accordance with and meet the criteria in the Systems Engineering Management Plan, Annex A Appendix E01 and develop and agree corrective action plans for this Anchor Milestone’s acceptance criteria, as appropriate, at the completion of this Design / Readiness Review.} Noting that this was within the project's approvals it was 2 months late against the contract.

January 2013 - SciSys Electronic Architecture Software Build 2
{Conduct Electronic Architecture

Preliminary Design Review in accordance with Systems Engineering Management Plan, Annex A

Appendix E01, Corrective action plans developed and accepted at the completion of the Electronic Architecture Preliminary Design Review and Electronic Architecture Software Build 2 Test Report complete and approved}

The next planned milestone, Preliminary Design Review (PDR), is forecast for April 2013 in the contract , and it is anticipated to be delayed.

# A.5 Capability Risks

Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme will upgrade the current Warrior fleet, some of which have been upgraded through a series of modifications and Urgent Operational Requirements. The current fleet is now restricted in it's capability on operations. The Out of Service Date for the non Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme Warrior fleet is 2025, so Warrior must be upgraded to avoid a long-term capability gap opening up.

Repair of equipment and supply of spares for the current Warrior fleet is provided through contracts with industry placed by Civil Servants employed by Defence Equipment and Support and Defence Support Group. A number of significant support contracts exist, with major examples being with Thales Optronics Ltd for the Battle Group Thermal Imager sights and a contract for the Diesel Engines and Transmission with Caterpillar Ltd. The support strategy for the upgraded Warrior will be similar to the current fleet. There will be an initial purchase of Capital Spares through the Manufacture contract to support the upgraded Warrior for a period of two years.
