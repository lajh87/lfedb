C Vehicles are currently deployed to Afghanistan, and were also used in Operation Telic. 225 assets are currently on Operations. C Vehicle equipment was also used to provide a temporary bridge over the River Derwent at Workington in Cumbria following the floods in November 2009.

This year over 60 new cranes and 33 truck mounted loaders have been introduced under the Equipment Refurbishment and Replacement Programme.

We are currently assessing the value for money of bringing Air Command and Navy Command into C Vehicles. However, no business case has yet been raised in support of this.

Outside of the PFI, the MoD has purchased protected vehicles as part of an Urgent Operational

Requirement for use on operations. The in service support for these vehicles is being provided by the PFI contractor, ALC. The first Urgent Operational Requirement procured 31 pieces of Protected Plant equipment and these have been deployed to operations. The second Urgent Operational

Requirement provides an uplift in numbers to the original capability as well as 12 Self Loading Dump Trucks and this is currently in the process of being delivered.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The C Vehicle Capability is required in order to provide the services with the means to carry out combat support, logistic and construction tasks in all climatic and geographical environments and across the spectrum of conflict. In particular C Vehicles provide mobility support to enable route construction and opening; survivability support, to enable the construction of protection and field defences; sustainability support, to enable the offloading of logistic supplies and to assist the construction of infrastructure facilities.

Management of the requirement with ALC and stakeholders lead to a cost reduction (-£2m) against that which had been originally identified. The cost was reduced following the final negotiations leading to the agreed contract price (-£6m). The set-up costs and ongoing project costs for project were also reviewed in line with the

contract obligations the estate, Management Information Systems and consultant support (+£2m) and the payment to other agencies for estate costs (-£1m). Realism to reflect delay in contract award (+£5m), re-scoping of project specific items (+£4m) and review of fixed price risk (+£2m). Adjustments in line with improved identification of MOD requirements during January–March 2005 in support of the PFI Service Provider including set-up costs for the Management Information System (+£2m), estates provision (+£1m) and initial service support (+£9m).

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Support Vehicle programme is procuring the future tri-service cargo and recovery vehicles that will increase the military material lift/distribution and recovery capabilities. The programme is procuring a fleet of vehicles consisting of 42 variants but effectively based around the Light, Medium and Heavy Cargo Vehicles (6, 9 and 15 tonne respectively), the 7,000 litre Unit Support Tanker, the Recovery Vehicle and the Recovery Trailer. These vehicles will replace the in-service 4, 8 and 14 tonne cargo vehicles and the three in-service recovery vehicle types.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

There was no Assessment Phase. The Support Vehicles programme had origins in the Future Cargo

Vehicle and the Future Wheeled Recovery Vehicle projects. These were launched as potential Private

Finance Initiative programmes in August 1998 and September 1999, respectively. The Future Cargo Vehicles project progressed through Pre-Qualification and Outline Proposal stages with five bidders short-listed. An Initial Gate Business Case was drafted in December 1999, but was not submitted for approval because it did not demonstrate value for money.

Further work was requested to identify areas for further innovation, and also to develop a ‘smart’ Public Sector Comparator. Work continued to produce a more robust case but it became clear that confidence in Private Finance Initiative procurement was unlikely to improve. The decision was taken in March 2001 to replace the Private Finance Initiative procurement strategy with a conventional strategy and hold a fresh competition. Furthermore the Future Cargo Vehicles and Future Wheeled Recovery Vehicle programmes were merged into a single procurement and preceded directly to the main investment decision which was secured in November 2001. The project bypassed the Assessment Phase because it was concluded that the technologies were mature and as the Department had, during the Private Finance Initiative phase of the project, acquired a detailed knowledge of the commercial vehicle sector, the risks were low. It was also necessary to avoid further delays in order to maintain industrial interest in the requirement. The time and cost boundaries were set at Main Gate and following an advertisement placed in the MOD Contracts Bulletin, a shortlist of six prime contractors was drawn up.

## A.3. Progress

The contract to procure 5,165 vehicles was signed on 31 March 2005 and this original contract was extended by a further 2,077 vehicles in July 2006. These extra vehicles were ordered following a comprehensive Investment Appraisal (and Review Note approval) which demonstrated it to be considerably cheaper to buy new vehicles rather than run on the rest of the in-service fleet.

The total Support Vehicle Programme provides 6,928 Cargo Vehicles, 288 Recovery Vehicles and 69 Recovery trailers, replacing a fleet of just under 15,000 in-service vehicles.

The first 6, 9 and 15 Tonne prototype (quantity 14) vehicles were produced and underwent formal Military trials, on schedule, in 30 October 2006.

The In-Service Date is in 2 stages – the In-Service Date for 161 Cargo Vehicles was achieved, one month early, in June 2007 and the In-Service Date for eight Recovery Vehicles plus two Recovery Trailers was declared in February 2008.
