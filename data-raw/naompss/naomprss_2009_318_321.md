# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The requirement is to continue the provision of airborne surveillance and battle management capability for Carrier Strike (delivery of full offensive air effort, at medium scale, from the sea) as currently provided by the Sea King Mk7 Airborne Surveillance and Control variant. This capability will support naval operations and shipping, especially the Future Aircraft Carrier; and land operations in littoral regions, e.g. amphibious landings. The system will conduct surveillance of air and surface targets, with the concurrent battle management capability allowing the command of assigned assets such as future UK Joint Combat Aircraft. This capability enables the protection of UK assets from attack and enhances the ability to conduct offensive operations.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The project passed Initial Gate in 2005, entering a planned two stage Assessment Phase, for which the Initial Gate approved Assessment Phase Stage 1.

Assessment Phase Stage 1 studied a focused set of solutions, having deselected a number at Initial Gate. Stage 1 included an assessment of extending the service of the current Sea King Mk7 aircraft. This extension of service was considered in conjunction with the adoption of a new airframe and mission system combination, as opposed to the previous programme assumption for the transfer of the Sea King Mk7 mission system to a new build rotary wing airframe. Assessment Phase 1 concluded that an incremental approach to acquisition offered the most cost effective route to the delivery of the capability, which was formalised during the Department’s Planning Round 2008 process. The first increment of the capability will extend the life of the Sea King Mk7 and maintain the operational capability of the mission system via a Capability Sustainment Programme. Assessment Phase Stage 1 was approved at an expected cost of £10m and a Not to Exceed cost of £13m, however due to the application of an innovative contracting structure and the non-emergence of anticipated risks, Stage 1 was concluded for £7m.

Assessment Phase 2, which received approval to proceed in mid 2008 (although funding release was subsequently delayed), will de-risk the Sea King Mk7 Capability Sustainment Programme to a Main Gate in 2010 at a cost of £7m. As a result of the decision to revise the programme assumptions in Planning Round 2008, activity against the second increment of the capability to replace the Sea King Mk7 was put on hold. A further Assessment Phase Stage 3 will be required early in the next decade to consider the route to delivery for the Future Solution of the capability.

## A.3. Progress

Comparative studies were made of the options to deliver the capability. The options ranged from extending the service of the existing Sea King Mk7, through migrating the Sea King Mk7 mission system to a new build rotary wing platform, to replacing the Sea King Mk7 with a new platform, mission system, and radar. This analysis concluded that the most cost effective delivery route is to extend the Sea King

Mk7 to an Out of Service Date of 2022 and introduce a Future Solution at this time. A Capability

Sustainment Programme for the Sea King Mk7 is planned, with a Main Gate in 2010, and an IOC in 2014. It is then planned that a Future Solution comprising a new platform, mission system, and radar will replace the Sea King Mk7 in 2022.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control capability provides Force Protection for the Carrier Strike (delivery of full offensive air effort, at medium scale, from the sea) and Amphibious Task Groups from which the capability operates by providing an assured surveillance capability to detect inbound threats to the Task Group. Without this capability the Task Group will have reduced situational awareness of air and surface targets at range, and will have reduced warning time to counter any inbound threats.
