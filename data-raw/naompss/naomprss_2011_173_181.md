1.  <u>Section A: The Project</u>

1.  The Requirement

Specialist Vehicles will be more fightable, survivable, lethal, and have a greater find capability than the obsolescent legacy Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) fleet that is overmatched by even the most likely threat. Specialist Vehicles will contribute to a combined arms capability of modern, medium-weight, strategically deployable, tracked vehicles. The current planning assumption is to deliver a Reconnaissance fleet of up to \\\ vehicles over three increments;
as part of the Department's 2011 Planning Round, the requirement for Medium Armour has been removed from the Specialist Vehicles Programme.

1.  The Assessment Phase

<th>
GENERAL: Future Rapid Effects System Specialist Vehicles entered its Assessment Phase (Assessment Phase 2) in June 2008. The approval covered the anticipated Specialist Vehicles fleet scope, with high priority afforded to Scout (Recce Block 1), given the pressing need to replace Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked). Specialist Vehicles was assumed to consist of three Recce Blocks plus Medium Armour and Manoeuvre Support components, all mounted on a common base platform. In broad terms the Assessment Phase Studies confirmed that the Common Base Platform concept was viable for all platforms and also set the time, cost performance and risk envelope for Recce Block 1. In accordance with the endorsed acquisition strategy, the Common Base Platform design will be used for Recce Block 2 and 3 with the addition of role specific sub-systems for each variant. Assessment studies will be used to determine the scope of each subsystem fit for each specific role. TRADE-OFFS: Assessment Studies were used to derive the preferred Programme Option and its associated characteristics of performance (requirements), cost, time and risk, ahead of launching a competition to select the Prime contractor. These studies included an analysis of potential solutions ranging from off-the-shelf platforms, modified off the shelf and new design as well as studies on critical sub-system choices e.g. primary sighting system. Industry was engaged throughout to ensure data used reflected market reality, whilst still keeping competitive choices open. The Military Customer and User were also engaged throughout the process. ACQUISITION STRATEGY: The Assessment Phase also determined the most appropriate Acquisition Strategy for the Specialist Vehicles. This product of this strand was subject to a separate Investment Approvals Board Approval. This approval endorsed the use of open international competition to select a 'prime contractor' to conduct the demonstration phase for Recce Block 1, and subject to further approval included progression to manufacture and initial in-service support, together with a Common Base Platform for all

Enter Text HereSpecialist Vehicles. Major enabling sub-systems e.g. Guided Weapons (missiles) for later Recce Blocks were not included in the scope of Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform in order to leave competitive choice for later Recce Blocks e.g. missile coherence with Team Complex Weapons.

MAIN WEAPON SELECTION - SCOUT: Approval for the selection of the 40mm Case Telescope Weapon System was given in 2008 to enable commonality with the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme, thus taking the benefit of common ammunition and training. Qualification for the 40mm Case Telescope Weapon System is led by the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme. The Assessment Phase included risk reduction studies and demonstrators on the Specialist Vehicles platforms and on the high performance thermal imaging sighting systems which were subsequently downselected as part of the main competition. The Recce Block 1 element of Assessment Phase 2 was conducted in four Stages, with the key finding from each stage captured in a Stage Report. The final Stage - the formal competition and Investment Approvals Board approval for Demonstration was conducted under an aggressive timeline with transition through Main Gate 1 achieved seven months ahead of forecast. In 2010, the programme was subject to re-approval by the new Coalition Government which delayed contract award by three months, as progress was halted due to the pre-election period. The Recce Block 1 element of the Assessment Phase concluded with a major international competition, which selected General Dynamics UK as the Prime contractor.

1.  Progress

MAIN GATE 1 - DEMONSTRATION RECCE BLOCK 1 ONLY: The outcome of the Specialist Vehicles

Assessment Phase for Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform was presented as evidence for the Specialist Vehicles Main Gate 1 approval for entry into Demonstration. As part of this Main Gate 1 approval, the Office of Government Commerce conducted a Gateway Review in September 2009, followed by a full Major Projects Review Group examination, which confirmed that Specialist Vehicles was in a position to proceed to its planned Demonstration phase with General Dynamics UK as the Prime contractor. Approval was re-endorsed by the new Coalition Government in June 2010. The contract with General Dynamics UK commits to the Demonstration Phase for Recce Block 1 only, and contains priced Contract Options (to be exercised later subject to approval) for the Manufacture and Initial In-Service Support Phases for both Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platforms to be used for later Blocks. This contract includes seven Anchor Milestones, the first of which is currently forecast for March 2012.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review and the Department's 2011 Planning Round removed the Medium Armour and Manoeuvre Support elements and reset the total vehicle fleet numbers to up to \\\, with the delivery profile recast to aspire to the emerging Army restructuring under Strategic Defence and Security Review (Five Multi-Role Brigades). Final size and shape of the Specialist Vehicles fleet will not be set until Main Gate 2, in 20\\, when the first major production investment decision will be taken. The Recce Block 1 Planned Assumption for Service Entry was also deferred by nine months from \\\ to \\\.

An Information Note and a Review Note are currently planned later in 2011 in order to capture the programme changes arising from the Department's Planning Round 2011 and the Strategic Defence and Security Review.

FURTHER APPROVALS - Manufacture and Demonstration of other Reece Blocks: It should be noted that Specialist Vehicles does not have a single Main Gate Approval. The size of the programme, together with previous lessons learned in other programmes, determined that a two-stage Main Gate approach should be used; Main Gate 1 for entry into Demonstration only, with a second Main Gate (2) for entry into the manufacture phase, the latter being the major investment decision. Further approvals (in effect sub-Main Gates) will approve Demonstration and Manufacture of later vehicle blocks (e.g. Recce Block 2) covering later

variants. Main Gate 1 did not set Initial Operating Capability, Full Operating Capability or total fleet requirements, but merely noted the planning assumptions associated with these for service entry at the time of demonstration launch for Recce Block 1. There was also recognition that the then forthcoming Defence Review would change total fleet requirements and assumptions and these should not therefore be set at Main Gate 1.

# A.4 Capability Risks

Specialist Vehicles will replace Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) which is increasingly becoming tactically un-deployable. Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) has already been extended beyond its Out of Service Date through a series of modifications and Urgent Operational Requirements. Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) is, however, restricted by its very small design meaning that it has reached its operational capacity. Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) must be replaced (by Specialist Vehicles) to avoid a long-term capability gap opening up in essential manned ground reconnaissance.
