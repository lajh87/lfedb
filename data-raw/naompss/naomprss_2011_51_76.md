# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

The military requirement is for up to 8 Astute Class Submersible Ship Nuclear to replace the existing Swiftsure and Trafalgar Classes of nuclear powered attack submarine.

Astute Class submarines are required to perform a range of military tasks; these unique requirements are combined within the Astute design to provide global reach, endurance, covertness, sustained high speed and the ability to conduct unsupported operations in hostile environments.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

In June 1991 (equivalent of Initial Gate) approval was given to proceed with a programme of studies at an estimated cost of £6m (1991/1992 prices) to define the Batch 2 Trafalgar Class Boat (now known as the Astute Class). This programme of studies led to the issue of an Invitation to Tender for the design and build of an initial batch of three Astute Class Submersible Ship Nuclear and a further approval of £2m (1992/1993 prices) for contractor and Defence Research Agency support to MOD during the tendering exercise in 1994.

In July 1994, as a result of concerns over the overall affordability of the programme, Minister (Defence Procurement) and the Treasury approved a further £24m (at 1993/1994 prices) for risk reduction studies to be undertaken in parallel with the formal bid phase of the project. To maintain an effective competition, contracts for risk reduction were awarded to both bidders, GEC Marconi (now BAE Systems (Submarine Solutions)) and Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd.

GEC-Marconi was identified as MOD’s preferred bidder in December 1995. Using the policy of No Acceptable Price No Contract, a Prime Contract was placed in March 1997 for the design, build and initial in service support of the first three of the Class.

# A.3 Progress

For Astute Class Programme historical data please refer to previous MPRs

Planning Rounds

In 2009 a savings measure option was taken removing £139M of funding from Astute Boats 2-7 from 2009 to 2013. The savings resulted in delayed delivery of Boats 2-4, which were already in build and defer build start dates and the procurement of long lead items for Boats 5-7. As a consequence of this, cost growth occurs in later years as reported in more detail in MPR 2009. During Planning Rounds 2010 and 2011 Boats 2 to 7 were delayed further to align with the deferred Successor Deterrent Programme, culmunating in the Strategic Defence and Security Review and the Value For Money Review which delayed the Successor In Service Date to 2028 and further delayed the Astute Class Programme to sustain industry. Together these form the basis of next year's budget.

Boat 1 HMS Astute

HMS ASTUTE successfully completed first dive and initial series of dived trials during February and March 2010, and successfully completed full power trials and deep dive on 30 April 2010.

In Service Date based on meeting the above criteria was declared and agreed by Investment Appraisal Board in

July 2010, retrospectively back dated to 30 April 2010. HMS ASTUTE continued with the Contractor's Sea Trials programme covering platform and initial capability proving trials, interspersed with planned maintenance and defect rectification periods.

HMS Astute was commissioned by the Duchess of Cornwall, the boat's patron, into the Royal Navy at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde, on 27 August 2010.

On 22 October 2010 HMS Astute was involved in a grounding and collision incident whilst on sea trials near the Isle of Skye and the British Underwater Test and Evaluation Centre on the west coast of Scotland. The submarine was floated off after 12 hours and following evaluation by the Head of Submarine Production Team and BAE Systems Engineers she returned to Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde under her own power. The submarine was repaired on the Faslane Ship Lift and left the facility on 24 November 2010.

HMS Astute reached Contract Acceptance Stage 1 Platform Demonstration on 29 November 2010 from which point it is managed as an In-Service Submarine under MOD rather than contractor direction.

HMS Astute returned to sea in early December 2010 for training to re-validate its navigational certification. The sea trials programme has been delayed by ten months due to First of Class technical issues, including modification of the Internal Communication System and the actions required recovering from the grounding.

Boat 2 Ambush

Boat 2 reactor core load was completed in November 2010 with the submarine named on 16 December 2010 and launched on 6 January 2011. It continues systems commissioning and preparations for Power Range Testing planned for late 2011, and sailing on sea trials anticipated Spring 2012.

Boats 3 to 7

During 2007 to 2010 Boats 3 to 7 have been delayed due to Boat 1 holding on to scarce resource for longer to deal with the technical issues, and also due to the MOD slowing the programme down to realise early year savings.

Boat 3 (Artful) completed final hull unit welding in May 2010; she is now a closed submarine. Final stages of outfitting have continued throughout the year.

Since the launch of Boat 2 in January 2011 Boat 4 (Audacious) units and modules are being moved onto the build line.

In March 2010 approval for Initial Build activities for Boat 5 was given, and Long Lead Items were ordered for Boat 6. The Project Summary Sheet currently only reflects these costs which do not represent the full cost of procurement for Boats 5 and 6

ASTUTE CLASS TRAINING SERVICE

The Astute Class Training Service was established through a Private Finance Initiative arrangement, to deliver the unique training required following the introduction of the Astute Class Submarines. Contract award was in 2001, with training delivery commencing in 2006. The current contract covers training for Boats 1-3 only because, at the time of contract award, there was no approval for the build of later Astute Class Submarines. Further approval was received in 2007, to include provision for Boat 4 (Audacious) within Astute Class Training Service and work is underway to add this to the contract.

SUPPORT

In July 2006 an Astute Class Support Review Note was approved to implement an Initial Astute Support Solution for four years and 5 months elapsed time, up to the end of December 2012.

STRATEGIC DEFENCE AND SECURITY REVIEW

In October 2010, the Strategic Defence and Security Review endorsed the political, military and industrial requirement for a 7-Boat Astute Class Programme leading to the Successor Deterrent Programme First of Class In Service Date of 2028, based on a 36 month build programme. Part of the Astute Class Programmes objectives is to sustain industry for Successor; therefore the revised plan for Astute Class Programme extended timeframes by an average of 14 months per boat. A Review Note to secure approval for revised time and cost parameters will be submitted to Her Majesty’s Treasury before September 2011.

# A.4 Capability Risks

Delivery of Boat 1 is critical to attack submarine’s readiness profile. Boat 1’s delay will result in the delayed introduction of improved capability over current classes. The Astute Class will also de-risk capability essential for an affordable Successor Deterrent Programme.

The Initial Astute Support Solution was approved in July 2006; it follows a traditional support model, but recognises Astute’s differences and introduces additional arrangements as appropriate. Provision has been made to employ the build contractor (BAE Systems) as the Astute Technical Authority; MOD will be the Approving Authority, with the Nuclear Propulsion Project Team responsible for the Nuclear Steam Raising Plant. MOD Equipment Project Teams will support specific equipments with Head of In-Service Submarine (Head of Submarine Production up to Operational Handover) maintaining a Platform focus and providing the flotilla wide single point of contact for Navy Command. Astute Class Maintenance at the waterfront will be conducted under existing Warship Support Modernisation Initiative arrangements. The Astute Class Training Service is a Private Finance Initiative contract, initially approved for 36 years to provide Astute Class specific training to the Royal Navy for Boats 1-3. Approval was given in 2007, to extend to a 38 year contract, to cover the life of Boat 4. Approval for later Boats will be considered during Financial Year 2011/2012 to support an Approvals strategy for training to be presented as part of Submarine Training and Education Programme during Financial Year 2012/2013
