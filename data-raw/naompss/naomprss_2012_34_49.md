# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

Project Airseeker seeks to sustain the UK’s airborne electronic surveillance capability previously provided by the Nimrod R1 aircraft and associated ground elements, against an evolving and increasingly complex target set up to 2025. It will provide a rapidly deployable capability to support operations where it will be able to collect, analyse, fuse and disseminate a coherent and readily interpretable electronic surveillance picture in support of national, joint and coalition operations. This information will support targeting and combat identification.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

Whilst the original concept of the Project was for the procurement of a modern mission system to fit into existing Nimrod R1 aircraft, in the run up to Initial Gate approval, other platform options were introduced and were subject to detailed assessment during development of the Main Gate Business Case. The assessment also considered ground analysis facilities, training facilities and a support solution to the planned Out of Service Date of 2025.

The Project received Initial Gate approval in August 2003. Eight contractors were invited to participate in a capability-based assessment and three were chosen to go forward to a competitive-based threestage Assessment Phase in April 2004.

The first stage required the contractors to show their understanding of the requirement, and resulted in a down-select to two contractors in April 2005.

In the second stage the remaining two contractors were required to define the system to meet the capability, proving their design through operational effectiveness modelling. This resulted in a downselect to a preferred contractor in April 2007.

When the down-selected contractor commenced the final stage of the Assessment Phase, a risk reduction exercise, it became evident that the cost of supporting the Nimrod R1, as the planned host platform, was likely to be significantly greater than anticipated.

Due to this cost escalation a change in strategy was made in 2008 to focus the remainder of the Assessment Phase on an investigation of an alternative to the Nimrod R1 as the host platform.

Work was undertaken to obtain a robust performance, time and cost envelope and a Main Gate Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in December 2009 recommending procurement of the United States Air Force Rivet Joint System under a Foreign Military Sales arrangement.

After Defence Board consideration of the Project’s cost and programme assumptions within the context of the Department’s 2010 financial planning round, the Main Gate Business Case was updated through a Review Note and an Addendum. The Investment Approvals Board approved the

Enter Text Hereupdated Business Case in March 2010.

Signature of the Foreign Military Sales Letter of Offer and Acceptance followed that approval.

# A.3 Project History since Main Gate

As from 1st April 2010 Helix became known as Airseeker.

1.  Letter of Offer and Acceptance was signed on behalf of the UK Government on 19 March 2010 which included a request for the USA Government to prepare and submit a revision to that letter reflecting the Planning Round 2010 settlement. Their formal response was received on 28 October 2010. Investment

Approvals Board approval to sign the revised offer letter was received on 24 March 2011. The revised Letter of Offer and Acceptance was signed on behalf of the UK Government on 24 March 2011. The revision to the offer letter has been augmented by additional information on how the USA Government Programme Office, known as Big Safari, intends making contractual commitments on behalf of the UK. The USA Government has been implementing the initial stages of the Foreign Military Sales agreement in accordance with a plan that is consistent with the Planning Round 2010 settlement. A major milestone was achieved on 14 December 2010 when the first donor aircraft for conversion to become the first UK Rivet Joint aircraft was taken into work at the USA facility in Texas.

In September 2010, Royal Air Force Headquarters Air Command signed an agreement known as the Co-manning Memorandum of Understanding with the operational wing of the USA Air Force that operates the Rivet Joint aircraft and ground systems. This agreement makes provision for UK crews to be trained by the USA Air Force, funded under the Foreign Military Sales case that is managed by the Airseeker Project Team, and then allocated to operational duties by the USA Air Force Rivet Joint Commander. The first of the RAF personnel started training in January 2011, with the first graduates ready for operational Rivet Joint deployments in June 2011. This conversion training and operational experience will provide the required quantity of trained manpower to meet the Initial Operating Capability whilst significantly de-risking the Training Defence Line of Development.

# A.4 In-year Progress

On 23 June 2011 the Chief of Defence Materiel signed on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence a Memorandum of Understanding for Sustainment and Follow-on Development that had been signed by the USA Under-Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) earlier that month, covering a Cooperative Agreement to provide support and capability updates for the USA and UK fleets of Rivet Joint aircraft and ground systems. This agreement runs to 31 March 2025.

In September 2011 the Ministry of Defence's Investment Approvals Committee approved the cost and time parameters for the Airseeker project reflecting the Planning Round 2010 settlement and the revised Letter of Offer and Acceptance submitted by the USA Government in March 2011. MPR2012 Section B has been updated to reflect the approved cost estimates rather than the noted cost estimates supplied for MPR2011.

The refurbishment and conversion of the KC-135 tanker aircraft that forms the basis of the first UK Rivet Joint aircraft is progressing ahead of schedule in Greenville Texas. The contractor encountered technical issues during the strip of the aircraft that have all been addressed with no impact to the delivery schedule and has taken the opportunity to de-risk later stages of the conversion programme by advancing some work when resources allowed this to be done.The contractor has also made purchases of equipment that will benefit conversion of the second and third aircraft. Delivery of the first aircraft to the UK is still planned for December 2013.

Progress on the Co-manning Memorandum of Understanding, whereby the USA Air Force trains and provides operational experience for UK aircrew is also on schedule. In early March 2012, 78 aircrew had completed their training at Offutt Air Force Base, 51 aircrew had completed an operational deployment with the USA Air Force Rivet Joint force in two operational locations and there were 10 aircrew on active deployment at a single operational location.

Design of the UK facilities to house ground exploitation equipment at the Joint Services Signals Unit (RAF Digby) has been agreed with the Defence Infrastructure Organisation. Options to house the aircraft maintenance facilities and training systems at the Main Operating Base (RAF Waddington) have been under review and a recommended option has been put to the Airseeker Project Board by the Defence Equipment and Support project team.

On 29 March 2012 the UK completed a 3 month exercise to investigate availability of technical evidence held by the USA Airforce that is required to support development of an aircraft type certification safety case and Release To Service in furtherance of the objectives set out in the Airseeker safety and Airworthiness strategy.

# A.5 Capability Risks

Loss of the capability to be provided by Project Airseeker would remove the UK’s ability to conduct theatre-level airborne electronic surveillance in the future. UK forces would be denied the ability to acquire timely intelligence from increasingly complex and rapidly changing electronic sources in the theatre domain. This would significantly reduce the ability to acquire, process and disseminate signals, communications and electronic intelligence to UK and coalition partners. Critically, the principal source of tactical data essential to the nature of current operations would be lost, substantially reducing the ability to conduct effective targeting and information operations.
