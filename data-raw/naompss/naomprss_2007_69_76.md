# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) will replace unguided MLRS M26 rockets from 2007 as the latter reach the end of their shelf life and enter a disposal programme. GMLRS rockets will be fired from modified M270 MLRS launchers: the requirement is for a rocket that will increase MLRS’s range from 30km to at least 60km, with a reduction in heat and smoke signature. The rocket will use the Global Positioning System and inertial guidance in order to achieve the required accuracy and significantly increase its effectiveness. The payload was initially planned to consist of bomblets, but in July 2005 the decision was taken to change to a high explosive Unitary Warhead taking advantage of an accelerated US programme. GMLRS is a modular design, to allow other payloads to be easily incorporated.

The increased precision of GMLRS will reduce the number of rockets required to defeat a target. This will allow stocks of GMLRS to be significantly lower than those for the M26 rocket, thus reducing the logistic burden and eventual disposal costs. At Main Gate, the UK's requirement was for 6,500 GMLRS rockets. However, reviews during the Equipment Planning (EP) process have caused the quantity to fluctuate, due to changing Customer priorities and funding constraints. In addition, Operational Analysis emerging from a related programme, Indirect Fire Precision Attack (IFPA), has led to a review of GMLRS quantities and delivery schedule. The required quantity of GMLRS currently stands at 4,080 rockets; of this quantity, 1,488 rockets will be procured under the GMLRS programme. Funding for the remainder has been transferred to the IFPA programme, under which further assessment of quantities will be carried out, to establish the future requirement for GMLRS in the context of the overall procurement of IFPA munitions.

The UK placed an order for its first batch of GMLRS rockets (654) in August 2005, via the US Department of Defense, and deliveries commenced in January 2007. To date only the UK has formally entered into collaborative manufacture, with the US. The In Service Date for GMLRS was achieved on 30 March 2007.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

An approval equivalent to Initial Gate was obtained in July 1998 for the UK to participate in a collaborative GMLRS Assessment Phase with the other MLRS Partner Nations (France, Germany, Italy and the US). As part of this phase, and acting on behalf of the Partner Nations, the US

Department of Defense (DOD) awarded a prime contract to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire

Control (LMMFC) in November 1998 to develop a GMLRS carrier rocket. The UK contributed 12.5% of the cost of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract. The EMD contract was completed in early 2003, having been extended by the DOD from its earlier planned end date of November 2002. This extension, together with protracted negotiations with the US regarding the arrangements for manufacture, caused the deferral of Main Gate approval from December 2002 to August 2003. The purpose of the EMD phase was to reduce costs and risk through the use of offthe-shelf components and sub-assemblies, and by maximising sub-contractor competition. All MLRS Partner Nations have equal rights to the design resulting from the EMD contract.
