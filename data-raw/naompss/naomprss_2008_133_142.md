# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

The Support Vehicle programme will procure the future tri-service cargo and recovery vehicles that will increase the military materiel lift/distribution and recovery capabilities. The programme will procure a fleet of vehicles consisting of 42 variants but effectively based around the Light, Medium and Heavy Cargo Vehicles (6, 9 and 15 tonne respectively), the 7,000 litre Unit Support Tanker, the Recovery Vehicle and the Recovery Trailer. These vehicles will replace the in-service 4, 8 and 14 tonne cargo vehicles and the three in-service recovery vehicle types.

The contract to procure 5,165 vehicles was signed on 31 March 2005 and this original contract was extended by a further 2,077 vehicles in July 2006. These extra vehicles were ordered following a comprehensive investment appraisal (and Review Note approval) which demonstrated it to be considerably cheaper to buy new vehicles rather than run on the best of the in-service fleet. The first 6, 9 and 15 Tonne prototype (quantity 14) vehicles were produced and have undergone formal Military trials which commenced, on schedule, on 30 October 2006.

The total Support Vehicle Programme provides 6,928 Cargo Vehicles, 288 Recovery Vehicles and 69 Recovery trailers, replacing a fleet of just under 15,000 in-service vehicles.

The In-Service date (ISD) is in 2 stages – the ISD for 161 Cargo Vehicles was achieved, one month early, in June 2007 and the ISD for 8 Recovery Vehicles plus 2 Recovery Trailers has been declared at February 2008.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

There was no Assessment Phase. The Support Vehicles programme had its origin as the Future Cargo Vehicles and the Future Wheeled Recovery Vehicle projects. These were launched as potential Private Finance Initiative programmes with advertisements in August 1998 and September 1999 respectively. The Future Cargo Vehicles project progressed through PreQualification and Outline proposal stages with five bidders short-listed. An Initial Gate Business Case was drafted in December 1999, but was not submitted for approval because it did not demonstrate value for money.

Further work was requested to identify areas for further innovation, and also to develop a ‘smart’ Public Sector Comparator. Work continued to produce a more robust case but it became clear that confidence in Private Finance Initiative procurement was unlikely to improve. The decision was taken in March 2001 to replace the Private Finance Initiative procurement strategy with a conventional strategy and hold a fresh competition. Furthermore the Future Cargo Vehicles and Future Wheeled Recovery Vehicle programmes were merged into a single procurement and proceeded directly to the main investment decision which was secured in November 2001. The project bypassed the Assessment Phase because it was concluded that the technologies were mature and as the Department had, during the Private Finance Initiative phase of the project, acquired a detailed knowledge of the commercial vehicle sector, the risks were low. It was also necessary to avoid further delays in order to maintain industrial interest in the requirement. The time and cost boundaries were set at Main Gate and following an advertisement placed in the MoD Contracts Bulletin, a short-list of six prime contractors was drawn up.
