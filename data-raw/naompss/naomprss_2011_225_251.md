<th>United Kingdom Military Flying Training System will deliver a coherent, flexible and integrated flying training capability catering for the needs of the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the Army Air Corps. The flying training system takes aircrew from initial training through elementary, basic and advanced flying training phases to their arrival at their designated operational aircraft. The current system is at risk of being unable to deliver the required quantity and quality of aircrew to meet the input standard for the Operational Conversion Units. The existing training platforms are approaching the end of their useful lives and include outdated systems that are unable to prepare trainees for current and future front line aircraft. The current system is based on a number of separate contractual arrangements for the provision of equipment and support. Consequently the system is piecemeal, difficult to manage and inefficient. It also introduces significant delays due to lengthy training programmes and gaps between courses. The focus for United Kingdom Military Flying Training System is to achieve a holistic system based on capability and service delivery; it is not solely about the provision of aircraft platforms. It also offers an opportunity to modernise the flying training processes for all three Services, realise efficiencies and, since training is currently spread across several organisations, take advantage of potential economies of scale. Advanced Jet Trainer The MOD requires an Advanced Jet Trainer for pre-operational training of fast-jet pilots. This task is currently fulfilled by the Hawk TMk1 aircraft, which will need to be replaced in the tactical weapons training role from 2010. The full range of skills required for aircrew to fly front-line aircraft cannot now be gained using the current jet trainer, so more training on operational aircraft has to be undertaken. The introduction of Typhoon and the future Joint Combat Aircraft exacerbates this training gap such that the required standard for Typhoon aircrew is not achievable with Hawk TMk1. The Advanced Jet Trainer (known as Hawk T2) is the Fast Jet element of the wider UK Military Flying Training System programme and will deliver capabilities including: a modern glass cockpit environment, an avionics suite compliant with latest airspace legislation, an embedded training system that simulates frontline sensors and weapons and a flexible and upgradeable mission system. Support, Infrastructure and a Ground Based Training Environment will also be provided. Advanced Jet Trainer is contracted for in such a way to ensure that it can be subsumed within the main UK Military Flying Training System contract at a later date.</th>

<th>
Four possible procurement options were identified at Initial Gate. The Do-nothing option was discounted. The Do Minimum option would not deliver the required quality and quantity of students in the correct timescales. The remaining options, Public Private Partnership/Private Finance Initiative and Smart Conventional, were tested in a Convergence Phase which concluded that the adoption of a Public Private Partnership Contractual Partnering model would best harness the collective skills of MOD and industry by utilising a mix of Private Finance Initiative and conventional procurement to deliver a coherent and flexible system of systems. This option envisaged the appointment of a Training System Partner to work with the MOD over the life of the project to deliver incrementally the total aircrew training requirement. The strategy was approved by Investment Approvals Board in February 2005. An Invitation To Negotiate was issued to three consortia in March 2005; the bids were received in August 2005. The Main Gate Business Case (Stage 1) was approved by Investment Approvals Board and Ascent was announced as Preferred Bidder in November 2006. The United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Main Gate (Stage 2) submission in the form of an Information Note was submitted in December 2007. This was approved by Minister (Defence Equipment and Support) and Treasury in February 2008. The Training System Partner Contract was signed in May 2008. Additional assessment work will be required post-Main Gate for the different training platforms that will be acquired incrementally. These increments will be subject to further approvals.

Contract award for the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System was May 2008. The head lease for the Military Flying Training System Headquarters Building was signed 17th April 2008. Enter Text Here</th>

Advanced Jet Trainer

At Initial Gate (December 2002) Advanced Jet Trainer was a component of United Kingdom Military Flying Training System. Within the £39m approved for United Kingdom Military Flying Training System assessment, £2m related to Advanced Jet Trainer and a PFI approach was assumed. In July 2003 a Ministerial Direction was given to conventionally procure Hawk 128 from BAE Systems.

In 2003 a £31m Risk Reduction Contract was placed with BAE Systems to cover risk reduction activities to

October 2003. BAE Systems continued to work at risk on Assessment Phase activities up to November 2004 when approval was given for a combined Assessment & Development Phase based on an incremental approach at a Not To Exceed price of £196m and a Not To Exceed completion date of August 2008; the Assessment Phase element of this approval was around £75m. A Design and Development Contract was let to BAE Systems in December 2004.

In May 2008 a contract was placed with BAE Systems to extend the initial demonstration and manufacturing phases to deliver the incremental capability (Operational Capability 2). The upgrade is primarily a software upgrade that adds synthetic simulation for radar, advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and surface to air missile threats.

Initial support contracts were placed in July 2008, August and December 2009 with BAE Systems to provide support capability for the aircraft at RAF Valley until December 2010. The In-Service Support Contract for the period to March 2014 was placed on the 31 March 2010.

# A.3 Progress

United Kingdom Military Flying Training System

Following award of the Training System Partner Contract the next phase of the programme was the provision of a training capability for the Royal Navy Observers – Rear Crew Training Stage 1. A Review Note was submitted in November 2007 seeking approval to issue the Invitation to Negotiate, this was approved in December 2007. In May 2009 the Main Gate Business Case was submitted and approved subject to caveats in relation to In Year Affordability and Safety and Environmental assurances. An Information Note was submitted in July 2009 confirming resolution of the caveats and the contract was subsequently awarded in July 2009.

Advanced Jet Trainer

Operational Capability level 0 was completed by BAE Systems in August 2008 and Release to Service was achieved in April 2009. Initial Spares have been delivered to RAF Valley, maintainers and conversion training for pilots completed and BAE Systems delivered the first production aircraft in February 2009. The

Operational Capability level 2 development programme is progressing to plan. Minister approved the InService Support Review Note in January 2010 with HM Treasury and commitment approval received in March 2010. To date 25 Hawk T2 aircraft have been delivered.

Advanced Jet Trainer - OC2

Operational Capability level 2 is an incremental capability to the AJT Operational Capability level 0 standard introducing in-cockpit simulation of sensors and weapons across a network of Hawk T2 aircraft. The development phase was placed on contract with BAE Systems at the end of May 2008 with Military Release to Service on the 18th February 2011. BAE Systems are on contract to embody the modification (datalink and avionics software update) to the RAF Valley fleet and work commenced on the 19th February 2011; to date 11 aircraft have been modified. The ground-based Mission Planning and Debriefing System has been made compatible with Operational Capability level 2 aircraft and development continues to provide full Operational Capability level 2 debriefing functionality by end 2011.

<th>Advanced Jet Trainer Infrastructure and Ground Based Training Environment Advanced Jet Trainer Initial Course Capability date is on schedule for November 2011, when the first ab-initio student training course commences. This date is aligned with the Advanced Jet Trainer Initial Operating Capability and has the same definition/requirements. All interim Ready For Training Use dates have now been achieved, specifically;
<ul>
<li>Ready For Training Use 1: interim Flight Training Device at RAF Valley – February 2010</li>
<li>Ready For Training Use 2: infrastructure at RAF Valley – October 2010</li>
<li>Ready For Training Use 3: Ground-Based Training Environment (excluding Full Mission Simulator </li>
</ul>
2) – January 2011
<ul>
<li>Ready For Training Use 4: Ascent Ground Instructors – December 2010</li>
<li>Ready For Training Use 5: Full Mission Simulator 2 – February 2011</li>
</ul>
The first phase to upgrade the Ground-Based Training Environment devices to Operational Capability level 2 standard has been contracted via Ascent. The work, involving the development of a set of requirements and a technical solution for the upgrade of the devices, is due to complete in July 2012. The work will include delivery of the first engineering release of the re-targeted Operational Capability level 2 Operational Flight Programme software for use in the Ground-Based Training Environment . Rear Crew Stage 1 Ready For Training Use 1 and Ready For Training Use 1a were achieved on 1st March 2011; all Training Service Enablers, with the exception of the KingAir 350ER Aircraft fitted with the Tactical Mission Trainer-Air, are ready for training to commence. This includes; Information and Communications Technology, Infrastructure, Ground-Based Training Environment together with Instructors and Pilots for both RAF Barkston Heath and RNAS Culdrose. This was a key milestone to the provision of the overall training system.</th>

# A.4 Capability Risks

The current training system is unable to train aircrew to the standard required, or to provide sufficient aircrew to meet manning requirements. Unless the training system is equipped to provide the skills needed, operational effectiveness will be seriously degraded. With legacy training aircraft fast approaching their Out of

Service Date there is a belief that the current system will not be able to sustain the front line in the long term. Financial provision made in 2010 to maintain coherency has demonstrated that support costs to extend current platforms are more expensive.

The Advanced Jet Trainer delivers the Phase 4 Fast Jet training element into the United Kingdom Military

Flying Training System project. There is a dependency on the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Project for the provision of Ground Based Training Environment to achieve Advanced Jet Trainer Initial Operating Capability.
