• Pre Main Investment Decision - Search and Rescue Helicopter

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Search and Rescue – Helicopter is a joint Ministry of Defence and Maritime and Coastguard Agency (an Agency of the Department for Transport) programme. It seeks to replace the current Search and Rescue capability, provided around the UK (and potentially the Falkland Islands) by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy, using Sea King Helicopters, and through the Maritime and Coastguard Agency service contract. It is planned to introduce the new service progressively in the next decade, when the Maritime and Coastguard Agency contract expires and the Sea Kings come to the end of their planned lives. Following Ministry of Defence and Department for Transport Ministerial approvals to enter Assessment Phase 2, a competition under the PFI, was launched in May 2006 under European Union procurement regulations using the competitive dialogue process.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The Search and Rescue – Helicopter Assessment Phase was approved in two Phases – Assessment Phase 1 and Assessment Phase 2. Assessment Phase 1 considered the range of procurement options as outlined in the Search and Rescue – Helicopter Initial Gate approval, resulting in a recommendation for a joint Ministry of Defence/Maritime and Coastguard Agency competitive PFI procurement strategy. Ministry of Defence Ministerial approval for Assessment Phase 2 to implement the joint Ministry of

Defence/Maritime and Coastguard Agency competitive PFI procurement strategy was gained via the Future Rotorcraft Capability Initial Gate Business Case and followed by Department for Transport Minister approval of a parallel Business Case. A joint Ministerial announcement of the PFI Procurement Strategy was made in May 2006 and the competition was launched through the Official Journal of the European Union.

Four consortia were down selected following assessment of their Pre Qualification Questionnaires in

November 2006: Augusta Westland; CHC Scotia Ltd/Thales UK Ltd (now known as “Soteria”); AirKnight (Lockheed Martin UK Ltd/VT Group Ltd/British International Helicopters Ltd); and UK Air Rescue (Bristow

Helicopters Ltd/FBH Ltd/Serco Ltd). The Competitive Dialogue with industry formally commenced in February 2007. In October 2007 Augusta Westland withdrew as an independent participant from the competition. Westland Helicopters Ltd was subsequently admitted to the UK Air Rescue consortium in January 2008 following the submission of a Pre Qualification Questionnaire addendum. Industry’s costed solutions for the first round of bidding were submitted in January 2008, and, following the withdrawal, for commercial reasons, of the UK Air Rescue consortium in September 2008, the two remaining consortia submitted their second round bids, against a refined requirement for a 12 base solution, in November 2008.

In February 2009, the two consortia issued respective press releases proposing their Search and Rescue - Helicopter aircraft solutions: the Airknight consortia have selected a single fleet of Eurocopter EC225s;
the Soteria consortia have selected a single fleet of Sikorsky S-92s.

## A.3. Progress

Detailed evaluation of bidder proposals is ongoing and is planned to conclude with concurrent Main Gate submissions to IAB and Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s Executive Committee in \\\ placement is planned for \\\

## A.4. Capability Risks

The UK Search and Rescue organisation is derived from the UK Governments adherence to various National and International maritime conventions dating from 1944 to 1979. Failure to replace the current service would risk contravening this established legal and moral duty. Consequently, the two organisations are combining their aviation acquisition expertise to plan a joint, harmonised replacement for the current service.
