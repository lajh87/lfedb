# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Lynx Wildcat capability was developed to meet the requirements for a dedicated small helicopter for use in both the land (Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter Requirement) and maritime (Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft Requirement) environments to replace the current Lynx fleet which is reaching its life end. Lynx Wildcat is a single-source, combined helicopter procurement programme with Westland Helicopters Ltd which follows More Effective Contracting principles. Project approval is for 80 aircraft, with funding for 62 held by the Integrated Project Team.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

Initial Gate approval was given in December 2001 for the Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter and in

September 2002 for the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft. Following review under the Future Rotorcraft Programme the Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter requirement matured into the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter requirement.

Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter:

The Assessment Phase benchmarked Westland Helicopter Ltd’s Lynx Wildcat proposal against alternative off-the-shelf solutions from other potential suppliers, and required the company to demonstrate the necessary level of performance to successfully deliver the Demonstration
& Manufacture phase.

Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft:

A single tender contract was placed with Westland Helicopter Ltd to develop and de-risk their Lynx Wildcat proposal to meet the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft requirement in conjunction with the approved Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter programme.

Procurement Strategy:

Two procurement strategies were considered. The first was to run a competition and second, to pursue the Westland Helicopter Lynx Wildcat proposal on a single tender basis - with an option to switch from single tender to competition should the Assessment Phase indicate that the Lynx Wildcat solution was unlikely to be cost effective. The second strategy was the selected one.

The result of the Assessment Phase considered the Lynx Wildcat to be the most likely of the options to deliver the required capability by the ISD. This gave the benefit of maintaining industrial capability in the UK. Hence a single tender approach was judged most likely to offer both the best technical solution and best value for money overall.

The Assessment Phase successfully de-risked a number of key requirements, including secure communications, mission systems and engine certification. Furthermore, Westland Helicopter Ltd’s Super Lynx 300 export programme demonstrated their capability to insert new T-800 engines, glass cockpit and avionics into the Lynx aircraft.

## A.3. Progress

The Demonstration & Manufacture contract was let in June 2006 to deliver 70 aircraft: 40 Battlefield

Reconnaissance Helicopters for the Army and 30 Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft for the Royal

Navy with costed options for five more platforms of each type. Preliminary, Interim and Air Vehicle Critical Design Reviews were successfully achieved in January 2007, October 2007 and April 2008 respectively.

The first airframe was delivered to the Westland build line in November 2008. Significant future milestones are: the Air Vehicle & Mission Systems Critical Design Review in August 2009 and First Flight in December 2009. The Equipment Examination 2008 concluded that reductions could be realised in procurement costs if the quantities were reduced to 34 Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters and 28

Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft, with the impact on delivered capability minimised through introducing design changes to achieve greater versatility between the two aircraft variants. The protracted period of uncertainty surrounding the project ended in December 2008 with the Ministerial announcement confirming that the project would proceed to full scale production.

Through-life training & support solutions are to be developed as part of the project. An Information Note was approved in July 2007 to submit the Support Solution Review Note in September 2009. Approval was also given for the Training Service Initial Gate Business Case in August 2007 based on the four-stage PFI Treasury Approval process. While investigating alternative ways to deliver the Lynx Wildcat capability during the Equipment Examination, the opportunity to deliver reduced through life costs was identified. A

Review Note was submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in December 2008 and approved in

January 2009, detailing a new strategy to explore a single source, integrated Support Solution and Training Delivery Service through the aircraft manufacturer, AgustaWestland and reflects a revised recommendation submission date to the Investment Approvals Board in mid 2010. Logistic Support and Ready for Training dates are not affected by this revised submission date.

## A.4. Capability Risks

These projects provide ongoing light helicopter capability in the land, maritime & littoral environments, beyond the out of service dates of the current Lynx helicopter fleet and introduce an enhanced maritime &
littoral attack capability. The reduction in aircraft quantities arising from the Equipment Examination is predicated upon a more versatile design solution allowing both aircraft variants to be utilised across a wider range of roles and environments, but with some minor trade-off against the achieved performance. This will place a greater necessity on the need to manage the two variants within a common in-service framework with commonality within the Defence Lines of Development.
