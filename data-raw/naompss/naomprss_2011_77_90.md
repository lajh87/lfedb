BEYOND VISUAL RANGE AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE

# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

The Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile system (the selected equipment is the Meteor system) will provide Typhoon with the capability to combat projected air-to-air threats and sustain air superiority throughout the life of the aircraft. The integration of Meteor onto Typhoon forms part of the project, with a current Initial Operating Capability of 2015.

Until Meteor is integrated, Typhoon will be armed with the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, acquired from Raytheon Missile Systems.

Key features of the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile requirement include stealthy launch, enhanced kinematics (giving increased stand-off and disengagement ranges, a better ability to engage and destroy highly agile manoeuvring targets), a large no-escape zone and robust performance against countermeasures.

This is a collaborative programme with: Germany, Spain and Italy (for Typhoon), Sweden (for Gripen) and France (for Rafale).

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

On 2 October 1995, Minister (Defence Procurement) gave approval for the issue of an Invitation to Tender for Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile. The Invitation to Tender was issued on 5 December 1995. Two bids were received; one from a consortium led by Matra BAe Dynamics UK Ltd (now MBDA UK Ltd), and one from Raytheon Systems Ltd. After extensive analysis, it was decided that both bids contained areas of risk that needed to be addressed before a development and production contract could be placed. In May 1997, a Project Definition
& Risk reduction phase was approved and contracts were placed on both bidders for a period of one year, with results to be technically and operationally assessed before a final decision was made. Both Project Definition & Risk reduction contracts were let in August 1997 and revised bids were received in May 1998. Due to the complexity of the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile assessment, the need to accommodate the requirements of the Prospective Partner Nations and the need to go for ‘Best and Final’ Offers (primarily as a result of a French request to join the programme), Main Gate Approval was not achieved until May 2000. In his statement to the House of Commons on 16 May 2000, the Secretary of State announced that the Matra BAe Dynamics Meteor missile had been selected.

# A.3 Progress

The contract for the demonstration, manufacture and support of Meteor was placed with MBDA UK Ltd on 23 December 2002. To date, the UK, Spain, France, Sweden and Italy have committed to production.

The Meteor programme continues to move ahead, with increasing confidence gained through the ongoing programme of guided firings and other activities towards the validation of the performance outturn of the missile.

There has been a three-month in-year slippage in Development outturn date owing to technical issues identified during pre-qualification activities, including the impact of a unilateral decision by one sub-contractor to change a component design for ease of production. This has delayed the start of the full qualification programme.

The programme of early integration work on Typhoon (CP270), which began in July 2009, is proceeding on schedule, and has been expanded to mitigate delays in getting the main integration activity on contract. These latter delays represent a threat to the achievement of In-Service Date 2. Further mitigation actions are under review.

The industrial proposal for full integration (SRP14) first submitted by EF GmbH in 2009 was revised by Industry in December 2010.

Project Summary Sheet

BEYOND VISUAL RANGE AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE

# A.4 Capability Risks

The Meteor capability is required to replace the current AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile whose capability falls significantly below that of Meteor. The procurement of the Advanced Medium Range Airto-Air Missile was a temporary solution to provide Typhoon’s anti-air capability for the period between Typhoon Operational Employment Date (June 2007) and Meteor In-Service Date. Whilst the continued use of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile is not expected to affect peacetime air policing, the survivability and capability of Typhoon in almost all operational roles will be compromised by non-delivery of Meteor. It will also necessitate an extension to the life of existing Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile missiles beyond the currently supported date, and will introduce a risk that stock levels will be insufficient to meet the operational needs. Should Meteor integration slip, there will be a need to address any gap in the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile capability.

It is currently envisaged that Meteor will be supported through Contractor Logistic Support arrangements, covering Post Design Services, Repairs and Surveillance and Life Extension. The final agreed strategy is dependent upon the outcome of the reliability trials within the development programme and information and decisions from the Meteor Partner Nations. The current forecast is that these inputs will be available in time to inform a support strategy submission to the approval authorities in during 2011.

<td>Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile</td>
<td>Extended reliance on the current AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile. The capability of the latter falls significantly below that of Meteor: its procurement was a temporary solution to provide Typhoon with an anti-air capability for the period between Typhoon Operational Employment Date and Meteor In-Service Date. Whilst the In-Service Date delay is not expected to affect peacetime air policing, the survivability and capability of Typhoon in almost all operational roles would be compromised by an extended delay. A staged transfer from Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile to Meteor is necessary owing to the latter's delivery profile, and hence use of Advanced Medium Air-to-Air Missile by Typhoon extends beyond Meteor In-Service Date. There is some risk that part of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile stocks will not endure until the revised In-Service Date and hence we may fall below the minimum required stockpile liability, although this cannot be confirmed at present.</td>
