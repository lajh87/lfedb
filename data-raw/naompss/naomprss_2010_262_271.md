## A.4. Capability Risks

Bowman and Common Battlefield Application Toolset, Digitisation Battlespace Land Infrastructure and Platform Battlefield Information System Application programme is the principal Land, Air Manoeuvre and Littoral Tactical Command and Control capability, enabling the planning and execution of operations at all levels at or below Divisional level. Without this programme the Armed Forces would be unable to undertake any form of land-based operations, including current operations.

In-depth repair is provided by the original equipment manufacturers under commercial arrangements put in place by General Dynamics UK Ltd Design Services. Used to analyse underlying problems from incident trends in the Field (identified through Service Management below) and develop solutions. Operates proactive obsolescence management at the component, product and system level through the supply chain. Finally, maintains and where appropriate improves system safety and security accreditation Service Management. Bowman is software intensive and provides information based services to the user. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library Service Management Framework has been adopted to implement processes for Incident Management, Problems Management, Release, Change Management and Configuration Control. Logistic Information System. Uses existing logistic information systems. The Bowman Asset Configuration Management System is a bespoke system developed to address a gap in configuration management in the Land environment. This gap is planned to be filled by an enhancement to Joint Asset Management and Engineering Solutions (Land Increment two in the 2012 to 2014 timeframe, at which point the Bowman Asset Configuration Management System will be withdrawn.

PR08 Funding restraints meant that a Through Life Capability Funding model could not be approved at that time. As a result of funding approved in PR10 a Main Gate approval will be sought in 2010 for a longer term sustainment package. Plans to transform the support solution in line with a Contracting for Availability model will depend on the future funding profile of the programme.

• Support Contract – C Vehicle PFI

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The armed forces require a range of support vehicles to support both peacetime and wartime operations. The previous C Vehicle fleet comprised over 4000 items of 150 types such as rough terrain earthmoving equipment, specialist engineer construction plant as well as field material handling equipment. These are held at varying degrees of military readiness and are capable of undertaking a wide range of combat support, logistic and construction tasks. The majority of the fleet is Commercial Off The Shelf, which has been modified to meet the military requirement. The fleet suffered in part from low availability due to heavy use whilst other elements of the fleet were only required for infrequent contingencies and were consequently under utilised. These arrangements were far from ideal and a PFI solution was agreed to address this issue.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

Initial gate approval was granted in November 2000 based on Pre Qualification Questionnaire documentation from six consortia. Three short-listed contenders were chosen to receive the Invitation to Negotiate released in March 2001. Throughout this period a process called ‘convergence’ was used to acquaint industry with the requirement and also to gain feedback on alternative solutions. The Invitation To Negotiate responses were assessed against specified criteria. At this time, the three contenders reduced to two, as two bidders combined to propose a consolidated bid. A further round of Revise and Confirm offers was requested in May 2002 with responses from the two consortia (Amey Lex Consortia and Fastex) in June 2002.

The evaluation of the two bids (ALC and FastEx) against the Public Sector Comparator was completed in early 2003 before final submission of the Main Gate Business Case to the Investment Approvals Board in March 2003. Whilst awaiting the Investment Appraisals Board and Ministerial decision, no interaction could take place with the bidders, however specific elements of the requirement were reviewed to address any inconsistencies and implement additional risk reduction measures. This process led to the revised Preferred Bidder documentation published in December 2003. At the time of announcing the Main Gate decision to proceed with ALC, it was also recognised that a funding gap had been created by the constraint placed in the used of IRDEL (non-cash) by HM Treasury. The funding requirements were discussed with ALC as the initial part of the contracts negotiations and with the Directors Equipment Capability (Ground Manoeuvre and Expeditionary Logistics and Support).

## A.3. Progress

The contract was signed on 10 June 2005 with ALC (SPC) Limited. The Operational Feasibility Test was successfully completed and In-Service Date declared on 31 March 2006. The remainder of the Implementation Rollout Phases were all completed on time leading to Full Service Commencement in May 2006. Through fleet management the C Vehicle Fleet today comprises 2,111 items of 150 types. The Equipment Refurbishment and Replacement Programme schedule has been amended in some areas since contract commencement to ensure best value for money is achieved.
