# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

The Team Complex Weapons initiative is based on meeting the UK's enduring requirement to have battle winning military capability through the use of Complex Weapons; to be assured that the weapons will perform as expected; and to retain the ability to develop leading edge Complex Weapons technologies.

Within this context, the initiative aims to deliver:

1.  Improved, adaptable and flexible Complex Weapons that can be shaped to meet current and future military capability needs;

2.  Freedom of Action and Operational Advantage in our Complex Weapons through a sustained indigenous industrial construct.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

In April 2008 an Initial Gate submission was made to the Investment Approvals Board for the Complex Weapons Sector. This was approved in June 2008. The Business Case sought approval to enter a non-competitive Assessment Phase with Team Complex Weapons. The Assesssment Phase was designed to test the viability of UK Sovereign acquisition of Complex Weapons through a modular and funding pipeline approach that offered greater value for money. This was consistent with the Defence Industrial Strategy in maintaining operational sovereignty of UK Complex Weapons and sustaining UK industry's specialist capabilities.

Initial work considered a number of options, ranging from non-competitive based around Team Complex Weapons to full open competition. The options were assessed on their ability to meet military capability, operational sovereignty and value for money measured against the draft Concept of Analysis. The analysis strongly indicated that the continued use of competition would progressively erode the MOD's ability to secure affordable and effective military capability and restrict future choice and decision making.

<th>The Team Complex Weapons proposition is founded on the Defence Industrial Strategy that set out the UK's intent to preserve operational sovereignty of its Complex Weapons. The first step in assessing the viability of a UK sovereign acquistion was a non competitive Assessment Phase which was approved by the Investment Approvals Board (Initial Gate June 2008). This covered risk reduction work to develop solutions to meet the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon, Loitering Munition;
Stormshadow Capability Enhancement Programme (SSCEP); Future Local Area Air Defence System; and Selected Precision Effects at Range (SPEAR) programmes. Review Note 1 (March 2009) sought approval of a second tranche of money to continue the Assessment Phase and Review Note 2 (November 2009) sought approval for funds to conclude the Assessment Phase and to address the questions raised by the Investment Approvals Board (July/October 2009). The Assessment Phase concluded that the preferred option was a long term partnering model based on bilateral arrangements with the Team Complex Weapons Prime Contractors. With the Strategic Defence Review on the horizon Interim Main Gate 1 (March 2010) proposed entering into a shorter term Interim Portfolio Management Agreement (PMA-I) with MBDA UK. It also sought approval for expenditure to meet only immediate Complex Weapons requirements specifically:
Loitering Munition (Fire Shadow) (Demonstration &amp;
Manufacture);
SPEAR Capability 2 Block 1 (Demonstration &amp; Manufacture) (now Brimstone 2);
Future Local Area Air Defence System (Assessment Phase);
SPEAR Capability 2 Block 2 (now Spiral Development) (Assessment Phase); and SPEAR Capability 3 (Assessment Phase)</th>

<th>Interim Main Gate 2 was the second of three submissions which sought approval for the Demonstration Phase of the maritime element of the Future Local Area Air Defence System (Maritime). This was approved in principle by the Investment Approvals Committee in April 2011 and in December 2011 Director General Finance confirmed that it was affordable. In the period since Interim Main Gate 1 and Interim Main Gate 2 were approved a number of the capabilities have been given formal names, viz:
Future Local Area Air Defence System Demonstration - Sea Ceptor D Loitering Munition - Fire Shadow SPEAR Capability 2 Block 1 - Brimstone 2 The formal names rather than the intial descriptors used in Interim Main Gate 1/2 will be used in the remainder of the Project Summary Sheet. 2011/12 Interim Main Gate 1 Fire Shadow Demonstration and Manufacture of the initial increment of Fire Shadow (Block 1B) was approved under Interim Main Gate 1.

Interim Main Gate 3

This was the third of the submissions and concerned approval for the Future Anti-Surface Guided

Weapon (Heavy) Demonstration and Manufacture Phase. The Business Case was presented to

Equipment Capability Secretariat on 9 January 2012 and was considered by the Investment Approvals Committee on 18 January. On 31 January Director General Finance approved the case, with a caveat that negotiations should be concluded with France before 31 March 2012. Bi-laterals continued, but by 28 March when Chief Secretary to the Treasury wrote to the MOD, discussions had not been concluded and as such Chief Secretary to the Treasury approved the case, subject to receiving French national approval. Reflecting this caveated approvals position and the absence of a final negotiated position on the Future Anti Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy) Demonstration and Manufacture Phase, standard Major Projects report practice has been followed meaning that this

# A.4 In-year Progress

Brimstone 2

Significant technical issues (e.g. propellant cracking and liner de-bonding) on the Vulcan rocket motor, manufactured by Roxel, were discovered in January 2012. Following considerable Red Team expert activity since March 2012 there is now increased confidence in this Roxel solution passing the testing environment and achieving In Service Date by November 2015. This is significantly later than that originally planned (October 2012), but the Red Team continues to work with Roxel to deliver the capability, although fallback options remain under consideration. To monitor Roxel's progress a series of Risk Gate reviews have been established with the final one, Risk Gate (4), planned for June 2013 which is a prerequisite before seeking Investment Approvals Committee Approval for the programme later this year.

In order to mitigate the risk on Operation HERRICK and potential Contingent Operations, resulting from the delay to the programme, the Defence Board has approved a Decision Point 2 Option for a further buy of Dual Mode Seeker (non Insensitive Munition) Brimstone missiles. This additional buy is jointly funded by MOD and MBDA and will be delivered later this year.

Sea Ceptor Demonstration

Seeker Critical Design Review was held on 22 August 2012 with the Defence Science and

Technology Laboratory which demonstrated seeker readiness for air carriage trials. A Guided Firing Readiness Review (Significant Milestone) was conducted on 27 June 2012 and the deliverable was accepted by the Project Team by 30 September 2012. Critical Design Review commenced on 19 March 13 with performance aspects to be completed in September 2013. Two Instrumented firings trials successfully conducted at Vidsel in April 2013.

The latest MBDA schedule risk analysis conducted in February 2013 concluded that the 50% date for T23 Full Operating Capability In Service Date in 2016 was within 3 weeks of the approved baseline. The Project Team is now conducting risk mitigation and further analysis in order to close this variance. MBDA’s project schedule has been refined from 2000 to 8000 lines of detail since April 2011, as part of routine Demonstration Phase business, bringing significantly greater granularity to task elements. Greater confidence can be derived.

Fire Shadow

Fire Shadow was initially expected to deploy on Op HERRICK in April 2012, but due to changes in the strategic Operation task it was agreed that it should not deploy. In September 2011, the MOD Sponsor directed that a User-led activity should be instigated, dubbed the Fire Shadow Capability

Demonstration, to inform future planning and investment decisions. The Fire Shadow Capability

Demonstration was outside of the scope of the original Interim Main Gate 1 and a Category D Capability Concept Demonstrator business case for the Fire Shadow Capability Demonstration was raised and approved in February 2012. Trials were completed in June 2012 and the final User report issued in November 12.

Driven largely by experience in contemporary operations, the overall Indirect Fire Precision Attack requirement (of which Fire Shadow is a part) was revised in 2012. As a result, before embarking on further Demonstration and Manufacture activity, an Assessment Phase is being planned to assess the optimum means to meet the new requirement. It will include the assessment of the extent to which existing systems and technologies, including those from the initial increment of Fire Shadow, will be exploited.

# A.5 Capability Risks

Interim Main Gate 1

Brimstone 2 - replaces the legacy Brimstone missile's energetics and airframe with a new Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliant warhead, rocket motor and an upgraded seeker and airframe. Brimstone 2 will replace the Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone capability currently in service with the Royal Air Force and will be integrated onto Tornado GR4 and is intended for integration on Typhoon. Spear Capability 3 is a new 100kg class weapon. This capability will be the primary air-to-ground armament for the Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA)/F-35B Joint Strike Fighter from \\\, and optimised for internal carriage. Spear Capability 3 will provide the means to destroy/defeat a wide range of targets at range, including mobile and re-locatable targets, in all weathers day and night, in complex environments under tight Rules of Engagements. The Indirect Fire Precision Attack programme will address the requirement to attack static and moving targets at various ranges. Within this, Fire Shadow will focus on the most complex targets where man-in-the-loop capability is required in order to ensure mission success and minimise the potential for collateral damage.

Interim Main Gate 2

The Sea Ceptor D implementation will provide increased capability over Sea Wolf that addresses the capability shortfall identified in the 2009 Capability Above Water capability audits.

The Sea Ceptor D solution is the only candidate to fill the capability gap that is both affordable and will meet the Key User Requirements (KURs) within the required timescales.

The current support approach is through individual contracts for each weapon type, e.g. Storm Shadow, Advanced Short Range Air to Air Missle, etc. The intent in Interim Main Gate 1 was to secure a long term arrangement for In Service Support under the Unified Support Environment with MBDA. The Unified Support Environment strategy has since been revised with the transfer of the explosives business stream of Joint Support Chain Services into Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) Weapons Operating Centre (WOC) and will be taken forward under the wider transformation activity required to deliver efficiencies into this business. The most recent contract with MBDA (April 2011) for the Sea Viper In Service Support arrangement will provide the benefits afforded by the Portfolio Management Agreement (Interim) including gainshare, and has the potential to act as a catalyst for In Service Support transformation in the longer term.

<td>Technical Factors In March 2011 Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone assets were deployed on Operation ELLAMY. This significantly increased the assumed consumption rate, due to an increase in operational firings and Air Carriage Hours. Given this increased consumption and assuming current consumption rates on Operation HERRICK, the current stockpile of Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone will be exhausted by March 2014. This, combined with the currently estimated 24 month slip to the Brimstone 2 project, leaves the Royal Air Force with a capability gap until the planned end of UK commitment to Operation HERRICK in December 2014. It also leaves the UK with a gap on any potential near-term contingent operations, which require a low collateral, precision strike capability. As a result of these emerging capability gaps, a Decision Point 2 option, to provide  Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone, was considered [and approved] by the Defence Board on 19 October 2012.</td>

Two CPS requirements were reported at-risk in MPR2012, these have now been met. Following changes to the overarching Indirect Fire Precision Attack requirement, arising in part from current operational experience, preparations for a new Indirect Fire Precision Attack Assessment Phase are underway. The Assessment Phase will consider the optimum solution/solutions to meet the revised Indirect Fire Precision Attack requirement, including exploiting investment to date across the Indirect Fire Precision Attack programme. Reporting against the Fire Shadow will not be carried forward in to future MPRs. Any follow on programme will be reported as appropriate.
