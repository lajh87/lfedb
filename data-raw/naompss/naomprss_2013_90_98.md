# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

To maintain a naval reactor Core Production Capability (CPC) to support the UK’s nuclear submarine flotilla. All Royal Navy submarine propulsion nuclear reactor cores have been manufactured at the Rolls-Royce (RR) Raynesway site.

To conduct nuclear operations on the Raynesway Site, Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations Limited is ‘Licensed’ formally by the Health and Safety Executive (Office for Nuclear Regulation) (HSE(ONR)) as required by the Nuclear Installations Act.

The technological and manufacturing capability to produce submarine reactor cores has traditionally been sustained through successive contracts for their production. With the introduction of long life cores and the reduction in the submarine flotilla size the numerical requirement for cores has reduced.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) White Paper deferred the In-Service Date (ISD) for the Successor SSBN to 2028 with a 36 month drumbeat.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

In September 2007, the Investment Appraisals Board approved the CPC Initial Gate Business Case, to down select to the phased regeneration of the Rolls-Royce Raynesway Site, as the most cost effective way of delivering the capability.

The Assessment Phase contract was let on 13th February 2008. This contract covered Assessment Phase work up to February 2010.

The Interim Contract was placed on 4th February 2010 to cover the work required to complete Assessment Phase activities up to placement of the Main Phase Contract on 23rd April 2012. In January 2012 the IAC approved the Review Note requesting release of funding against the Main Gate Business Case.

# A.3 Project History

April 2012: HMT approved the CPC Main Gate Business Case.

April 2012: Placement of the main phase CPC Contract.

May 2012: IAC approval of Main Gate Business Case.

# A.4 In-year Progress

May 2012 to January 2013: Construction Contract tender evaluation.

November 2012: Following the Licensed Site Periodic Safety Review (PSR), The Health and Safety

Executive’s (HSE) Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) concluded that normal operation of the Licensed Site can continue whilst a programme of work to implement a number of improvements is progressed.

December 2012: Rolls-Royce place Contract with sub-contractor CH2MHILL to provide the project support.

January 2013: Rolls-Royce place contract for construction with Graham Construction. Work commenced on site. The demolition of Nuclear Manufacturing Services was completed in January 2013 in preparation for the start of Phase 1.

March 2013: Demolition of the Operations Management Centre was completed.

May 2013: Manufacturing Facility 1st Build (MF1B) piling commenced.

Cores have been delivered in-year to support the submarine programme.

# A.5 Capability Risks

Delivery of the CPC project is essential in order to maintain the capability to manufacture nuclear reactor cores for the submarine programme and support development work on the Successor core design and manufacturing processes.

In May 2012, the Investment Approvals Committee approved £1190 million as the cost of the D&M phase. This includes £14 million which was subsequently advanced into the Assessment Phase in order to continue the programme whilst contact negotiations were finalised and has been accounted for as a cost to the Assessment Phase.
