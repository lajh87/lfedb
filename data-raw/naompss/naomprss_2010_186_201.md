# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Type 45 is a new class of six Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers, to replace the capability provided by the Royal Navy’s existing Type 42s. The warship is being procured nationally. The Type 45 will carry the Principal Anti-Air Missile System which is capable of protecting the vessels and ships in their company against aircraft and missiles, satisfying the Fleet’s need for area air defence capability into the 2030s. The Principal Anti-Air Missile System is being procured collaboratively with France and Italy. The Destroyers Team is responsible for providing the Principal Anti-Air Missile System to the warship Prime Contractor.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The Type 45 Destroyer programme builds on the Assessment work carried out in Phase 1 of the collaborative Horizon project, the warship element of the Common New Generation Frigate programme. Following the decision of the three Horizon partners (France, Italy and the United Kingdom) to proceed with the Principal Anti-Air Missile System, but to pursue national warship programmes, BAE Systems was appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999. The contract for the Principal Anti-Air Missile System Full Scale Engineering Development and Initial

Production was placed in August 1999. Main Gate approval for the warship was achieved in July 2000 and a contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture was placed in December 2000.

## A.3. Progress

BAE Systems Electronics was appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999 and a contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture for the first three ships was placed in December 2000. A contract for a further three Type 45 hulls was placed with the Prime Contractor in

February 2002. The ships are being built under sub-contract by BAE Systems Surface Fleet Ltd. The

Demonstration & Manufacture contract was amended to reflect the Investment Approvals Board SixShip Approval gained in August 2007. This change has introduced a staged acceptance process for each ship which commences with Acceptance off Contract, thereby giving control of the vessel to the MOD to undertake a further period of trials and acceptance activity leading to the declaration of InService Date. It was announced in June 2008 that as part of the Department’s 2008 Planning Round the decision was taken not to take up the option to proceed with Type 45 Ships 7 and 8.

The past year has seen significant progress in the manufacture of the six ships. All ships are now in production. The first ship, HMS Daring was commissioned into the Royal Navy in July 2009. A contract for up to seven years of Support for Type 45 was awarded to BAE Systems Surface Ships Ltd in September 2009. The fifth Type 45, Defender, was launched in October 2009. The second ship (Dauntless) was Accepted off Contract from the Prime Contractor in December 2009. Test firings of the Principal Anti-Air Missile System took place in May and November 2009. These test firings did not meet all of their planned trials objectives.

During the Department’s 2010 Planning Round a decision was taken to amend the production programme of Aster Missiles. This decision deferred production of some missiles, reducing costs in early years, but adding
£46M to the overall cost of the Principal Anti-Air Missile System programme. However, the effect of other Planning Round decisions and the benefits accrued through the good progress of the Ship programme, mean that the result is no overall cost growth of the T45 programme.

## A.4. Capability Risks

In order for a force of ships to operate safely at sea and project power onto the land, it has to reduce its susceptibility to attack from the air. The current generation of anti-air warfare capability (Type 42 Destroyer) has already been extended beyond its design life and is now rapidly approaching its out of service date. The Type 45 Destroyer will ensure that UK maritime forces retain a sufficiently robust capability to counter the growing threat from the air for the next 25 years. Without the Type 45, the UK would be severely limited in its ability to operate maritime forces in all but the most benign environments. There would also be a significant shortfall in the number of ships available to deploy world-wide in support of wider British interests, fulfilling roles from defence diplomacy to disaster relief to crisis intervention.

## A.7. Support Strategy

There are 3 broad layers to Type 45 Destroyer support:

1.  <u>Interim Support</u> (Support to Stage 2 Trials) covers the period from the First of Class (HMS Daring) Acceptance off Contract to In-Service Date. The change to ship acceptance approved as part of wider programme re-approval in August 2007 advances the date that the First of Class is accepted off contract, consequently requiring interim support arrangements to be put in place until In-Service Date. Funding for Interim Support was approved under the Six Ship Approval and costs are reported against the Demonstration &
Manufacture phase costs for Type 45, hence this element is not reported further within the Support section. The Interim support contract will complete at In-Service Date for HMS Daring. For the other five Type 45s support to Stage 2 Trials will be provided under the Full Support contract, although, as above, funding was approved under the Six Ship Approval and costs are reported against the Demonstration & Manufacture phase costs for Type 45.

2.  <u>Type 45 Initial Spares (Industrial Investment and Long Lead spares)</u>. Purchase of long-lead spares and industrial mobilisation activities for which contracts need to be placed ahead of the Type 45 Full Support Solution (see c. below) in order to be available for In-Service Date. The Approval did not set any Time limits for contract end dates, therefore only progress against Cost boundaries is reported within the Support section.

3.  <u>Full Support</u>. Phase 1 of the long term support strategy is the delivery of a Class wide Type 45 Support Solution through a single source incentivised contract with BAE Systems Surface Fleet Ltd as the support integrator for Type 45. Support will then migrate into the Surface Ship Support Programme (SSSP). The Full Support contract for the warship (the Phase 1 work described above)

was placed in September 2009. It includes the activities to establish the support solution infrastructure and team and then to provide up to 7 years In-Service support. Support to the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) will be provided by a separate single source incentivised contract with MBDA (UK). Negotiations for this contract are ongoing.

Proposal from BAE Systems (+11 months). Refinement of timescale risk analysis shows that there are a number of opportunities in the programme which support a most likely date of December 2009. Principal among these is the opportunity for parallel working that is not yet fully exploited within industry’s plan and the potential to use the second ship to demonstrate elements of First of Class capability (-1 month). Impact of slippage to SAMPSON programme and measures taken to mitigate the full impact of that delay (+3 months). Assessment based on full timescale risk analysis (conducted jointly with BAE Systems) which gave a most likely date of March 2010, based on baseline programme. Agreement reached with company and Customer 1, however, on how Stage 2 trials programme can be de-scoped thereby giving a Most Likely date of October 2009 (+ 2 months). Latest assessment based on timescale risk analysis of most up to date programme reflecting descoping of trials programme (+3 months).

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Typhoon

Typhoon, formerly known as Eurofighter, is an agile multi-role combat aircraft. Originally designed primarily, but not exclusively, for air superiority the aircraft is also capable of delivering a precision ground attack capability. Typhoon has the flexibility to respond to the uncertain demands of the current strategic environment and is progressively replacing the Tornado F3 and Jaguar aircraft.

The aircraft is being developed, produced and supported in a collaborative project with Germany, Italy and Spain. The project is managed on behalf of the four partner nations by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency. To date, contracts have been placed for the RAF to receive 160 aircraft in three tranches. Typhoon support is being delivered through the letting of long-term contracts against five areas of support.

Typhoon Future Capability Programme

The Typhoon Future Capability Programme will provide enhancements to the Typhoon aircraft, both in the air-to-air and air-to-surface roles, to sustain the RAF’s Typhoon fleet’s multi-role capabilities.

The first phase of the Future Capability Programme, under a contract signed in March 2007, will integrate Paveway IV and the Litening III Laser Designator Pod onto Tranche 2 aircraft from 2012 as well as interoperability upgrades without which those aircraft will be neither compliant with new civil airspace regulations nor interoperable with key coalition allies. It will also provide the Human Machine Interface for Multi-Role operations, allowing Typhoon to fulfil air-to-air and air-to-surface operations with the current, planned and projected weapons.

The second phase of the Future Capability Programme is planned as part of the MOD’s Future Defence Programme announced in December 2009.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

Typhoon

Pre-Development, which commenced with the approval of the feasibility study in 1984, comprised a number of activities. Following early concept studies, and various efforts at establishing a collaborative programme, there were two key Typhoon demonstration activities completed by the UK before development: the Experimental Aircraft Programme, an airframe programme primarily aimed at proving the feasibility of the Typhoon unstable flight control concepts, and the XG40 engine demonstrator programme at Rolls Royce. The results of these demonstrators and their associated studies, together with the results of similar work within the other Nations were harmonised in a Definition, Refinement and Risk Reduction phase that ran from the end of 1985 when four Nations signed the initial Memorandum of Understanding, until 1988 when the development contract was signed.

Typhoon Future Capability Programme

The approval process for Typhoon Tranche 2 noted the intention to develop the capability of the aircraft through life and envisaged an incremental route to the acquisition of future capability
