• Post Main Investment Decision - Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme will update 30 Merlin Mk1 aircraft to overcome existing and forecast obsolescence within the Weapon System Avionics to ensure sustainment of the required capability until the planned Out of Service Date (2029). The converted aircraft will be known as the Merlin Mk2.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

Assessment Phase

Following approval of the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme Initial Gate Business Case, the Assessment Phase contract was placed on 3 June 03. The main Assessment Phase activities comprised:

-   Analysis of the User Requirements and development of a consolidated set of system requirements in the form of a Systems Requirements Document.

-   Production of System and Sub-System design requirements, and seeking initial costed proposals from potential suppliers.

-   Conducting trade-off studies to identify the best value solution where options exist.

-   Developing a coherent plan for Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme, aligned to other existing and planned Merlin programmes.

-   Undertaking Integrated Test, Evaluation and Acceptance planning.

-   Identification of the risks to the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme, and the identification and implementation of mitigation action to reduce the impact to an acceptable level.

-   Produce documentation and costed proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase. • Undertaking initial Integrated Logistic Support activities to define a solution compliant with the evolving Support Solution Envelope.

Future Rotorcraft Capability Review

During the Assessment Phase, MOD embarked on a review of all future rotorcraft requirements under the title of the Future Rotorcraft Capability review. The Demonstration & Manufacture Proposal that had been provided by Industry and the associated business case were produced before the impact of the Future Rotorcraft Capability review was known. The Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme was reviewed as part of the wider Future Rotorcraft Capability programme. The Future Rotorcraft Capability programme determined that the balance of financial investment over the first four years of the Equipment Programme between Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme and Lynx Wildcat should be on a 50/50, 30/70, 30/70, 30/70 basis respectively.

To allow Industry to continue critical path activity and to support the reprogramming activities resulting from Future Rotorcraft Capability, the Future Rotorcraft Capability programme provided Transition Phase funding (six months) to the Merlin Integrated Project Team for an extension to the Assessment Phase contract.

A further transition phase (six months) was required to again sustain programme momentum, align it with wider Future Rotorcraft Capability requirements and maintain programme viability during the approvals process.

## A.3. Progress

The programme remains on track and is focused on the completion of Training System Design Reviews (April and September 2009), following the successful aircraft system critical design review in September 2008.

At Main Gate, the Investment Approvals Board had acknowledged that the current requirement was for 38 aircraft but only approved the initial procurement of 30. This was to allow a decision of the remaining eight aircraft to be made at a later date. Work during this year has culminated in the decision not to convert the remaining eight aircraft from Mk1 aircraft to the new Mk2 standard.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Merlin Mk1 is responsible for delivering protection to the Royal Navy’s fleet from sub surface threats. It also provides a significant contribution to their overall situational awareness both above and below the water. The programme is designed to sustain the capability out to the current Out of Service Date. Without this programme the ability to detect sub-surface threats would be reduced or if the obsolescence issues were addressed through an alternate strategy (piecemeal approach) lead to a large increase in Through Life Costs.

The support strategy of the Merlin Mk2 will be the same as that employed for the current UK Merlin (Mk1 &amp; Mk3), namely Integrated Merlin Operational Support contract. Integrated Merlin Operational Support is a whole life aircraft availability contract that is priced by flying hours within a defined band with incentives to generate fit-for purpose aircraft to the Front Line. There are five key elements of the Integrated Merlin Operational Support Service:

Affordability decision taken prior to contract award meant that the ability to train Mk1 personnel concurrently with conversion of the training facilities to the Mk2 standard was not possible. This gives rise to the risk that trained personnel will not be available to sustain Mk1 capability to its out of service and develop those required for Mk2.
