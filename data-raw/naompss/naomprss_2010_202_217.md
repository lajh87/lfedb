enhancements. The Assessment Phase found technology and integration were not a major challenge and that risks mostly pertained to the commercial and industrial aspects of the programme. These have been addressed and the MOD approvals process for the project was accelerated to combine Initial Gate, including the cost already incurred during the Assessment Phase, and Main Gate in order to maximise efficiency across the four Partner Nations.

## A.3. Progress

Typhoon has been in service with the RAF since 2003 and commenced operational duties for the first time in June 2007 when it assumed Quick Reaction Alert responsibility for defence of UK airspace. Deployable Air Defence operational status was achieved on 1 January 2008, which enables Typhoon to deploy worldwide on air-to-air missions. Typhoon was declared to NATO in the deployable Air Defence – Advanced role on 1 April 2008. Typhoon assumed Quick Reaction Alert responsibility for defence of South Atlantic Islands airspace in September 2009, taking over from Tornado F3.

The existing advanced air-to-air missile capability on Tranche 1 aircraft has been complemented by the integration of an initial precision air-to-surface capability, which was declared combat ready by the RAF in July 2008. This air-to-surface capability enabled declaration of multi-role status and is in advance of more comprehensive air-to-surface capability through the Typhoon Future Capability Programme for Tranche 2 aircraft.

Deliveries of Tranche 2 aircraft commenced in October 2008. The original Typhoon fleet numbers required (232 aircraft) were established in the 1990s. Current fleet planning and assumptions to meet defence requirements have determined the aircraft numbers and capabilities now required (160 aircraft). The contract for the third Tranche, signed in July 2009, represents the best solution for the UK in balancing current military requirement and international obligations against affordability. The UK has retained the option to order further aircraft. Deliveries of Tranche 3 aircraft are scheduled to start in 2013.

The Typhoon Availability Service contract with BAE Systems, signed in March 2009 formally commenced in September 2009. The Engine Availability Service contract with Rolls-Royce was signed in December 2009. These contracts are part of the strategy to transform support arrangements through partnering with UK industry.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Typhoon is intended to be a cornerstone of UK air defence and the aircraft will be pivotal to the delivery of Standing Home Commitments. Having replaced Jaguar in the ground attack role and with future reductions in other aircraft types planned, loss of Typhoon would reduce the UK’s groundattack and air superiority capabilities.

<th colspan="5">Typhoon’s partnered support strategy was originally approved in 2000. Its principles were reinforced by the results of a 2004 Support Review. The partnered support strategy – referred to as Typhoon Future Support - will be delivered through the letting of long-term contracts against five areas of support: for the Typhoon Availability Service on BAE Systems; for the propulsion availability service on Rolls-Royce; for Avionics (Spares Provisioning and Component Repair) via the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency; and for international Technical Support Services, also via the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency. Valuable experience has already been gained through the letting of incremental contracts to transform Typhoon support, the first of which was the initial phase of the engine availability contract with Rolls-Royce in 2005.</th>

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

United Kingdom Military Flying Training System will deliver a coherent, flexible and integrated flying training capability catering for the needs of the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the Army Air Corps. The flying training system takes aircrew from initial training through elementary, basic and advanced flying training phases to their arrival at their designated operational aircraft. The current system is at risk of being unable to deliver the required quantity and quality of aircrew to meet the input standard for the Operational Conversion Units. The existing training platforms are approaching the end of their useful lives and include outdated systems that are unable to prepare trainees for current and future front line aircraft. The current system is based on a number of separate contractual arrangements for the provision of equipment and support. Consequently the system is piecemeal, difficult to manage and inefficient. It also introduces significant delays due to lengthy training programmes and gaps between courses.

The focus for United Kingdom Military Flying Training System is to achieve a holistic system based on capability and service delivery; it is not solely about the provision of aircraft platforms. It also offers an opportunity to modernise the flying training processes for all three Services, realise efficiencies and, since training is currently spread across several organisations, take advantage of potential economies of scale.

Advanced Jet Trainer

The MOD requires an Advanced Jet Trainer for pre-operational training of fast-jet pilots. This task is currently fulfilled by the Hawk TMk1 aircraft, which will need to be replaced in the tactical weapons training role from 2010 onwards. The full range of skills required for aircrew to fly front-line aircraft cannot now be gained using the current Advanced Jet Trainer, so more training on operational aircraft has to be undertaken. The introduction of Typhoon and the future Joint Combat Aircraft exacerbates this training gap such that the required standard for Typhoon aircrew is not achievable with Hawk TMk1.

The Advanced Jet Trainer is the Fast Jet element of the wider UK Military Flying Training System programme and will deliver capabilities including: a modern glass cockpit environment, an avionics suite compliant with latest airspace legislation, an embedded training system that simulates front-line
