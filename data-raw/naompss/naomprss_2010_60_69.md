# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

A400M is planned to provide tactical and strategic mobility to all three Services. The required capabilities include: operations from airfields and semi-prepared rough landing areas in extreme climates and all weather conditions by day and night; carrying a variety of equipment including vehicles and troops over extended ranges; air dropping paratroops and equipment; and being unloaded with the minimum of ground handling equipment. The 1998 Strategic Defence Review confirmed a requirement for an airlift capability to move large single items such as attack helicopters and some Royal Engineers’ equipment and concluded that this would be met, in the latter part of the first decade of the 21^st^ Century, by Future Transport Aircraft. The A400M was selected to meet this requirement. It will replace the remaining Hercules C-130K fleet.

A400M is a collaborative programme involving seven European nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and United Kingdom). The design phase is nearing completion and manufacture activities have commenced. Delivery of the first UK aircraft to the Royal Air Force is expected in 2014.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The Government announced in December 1994 that it would replace its ageing C-130K Hercules fleet, in part by procuring 25 C-130J’s from Lockheed Martin and in addition, subject to certain conditions, by rejoining the next phase of the collaborative Future Large Aircraft programme (now known as A400M). The Future Large Aircraft ‘Initial Gate’
approval was achieved in July 1997 and in the same year the solution assumed for costing purposes was changed to an initial lease of four C-17 and subsequent procurement of 25 Future Large Aircraft. A Request For Proposals was issued to Airbus in September 1997 on behalf of the seven Future Large Aircraft nations (Belgium, France,

Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey and UK). Subsequently, in July 1998, four nations (Belgium, France, Spain and UK) issued a “competitive Request For Proposals” for a Future Transport Aircraft to Airbus Military Company (A400M), Boeing (C-17) and Lockheed Martin (C-130J).

Proposals were received on 29 January 1999 and parallel national and international assessments were undertaken. These covered Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisal, technical and commercial compliance, risk assessment, and an appraisal of the international dimensions. This work also led to parallel negotiations and clarification with the three bidders. At the direction of the Equipment Approvals Committee in December 1999, additional work was undertaken to inform the Main Gate submission. On 16 May 2000 the Government announced the decision to procure 25 A400M aircraft to meet the Future Transport Aircraft requirement.

## A.3. Progress

The very significant programme milestone of the first flight of the prototype A400M took place on 11

December 2009 in Seville. Flight trials continue and, on 9 March 2010, the A400M prototype (MSN001) flew from Seville to Toulouse for the next stages of flight trials. Also of note is the conclusion of the Flying Test Bed trials programme in September 2009.

Nevertheless, the past year has again been challenging for the programme. In November 2008 Airbus announced that first flight may not happen until the second half of 2009 and, in January 2009, proposed a
“new approach” to the programme and announced that they wished to discuss the programme schedule and certain technical characteristics of the aircraft with customers. In March 2009 the UK and its Partner Nations agreed to enter a “standstill” agreement with Airbus Military, the purpose of which was to enable possible options and outcomes for the A400M programme to be discussed without prejudicing the rights of either party under the existing contract. Initially to run for three months from April until the end of June 2009, the “standstill” period was extended to include July. In July 2009 the UK agreed to join Partner Nations in a negotiation phase with Airbus Military to determine the way ahead for the A400M programme. A further “standstill” phase covering the renegotiation period was agreed; initially valid until 31 December 2009, it was subsequently extended to 31 January 2010. During the renegotiation period extensive discussions at official and ministerial level took place between Nations and with Airbus Military and its parent organisations Airbus and EADS. As the renegotiation phase progressed, it became clear that the A400M programme would only remain viable with further investment from Partner Nations. The UK expects to manage this additional funding through a reduction in the number of aircraft (from 25 to not less than 22) it receives. At a Ministerial meeting in Berlin on 5 March 2010 agreement in principle was reached between Partner Nations and EADS on re-baselining the programme. It is now planned that these principles will be embodied in an amended contract, which is expected to be concluded later this year.

The principal factor for the delay to the programme has been its technical complexity. Airbus Military has admitted that it had previously underestimated the challenges of this programme and the Nations’ review of the programme has concluded that there has been poor management and control by the Company. Central to the renegotiation process has been close working between Partner Nations and Airbus Military to review the management and governance structures of the A400M programme.

The programme remains in a volatile and uncertain position whilst negotiations towards a revised contract continue, and the Department plans to carry out a thorough review of the programme later in 2010 when the revised programme is established.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Not proceeding with this capability would significantly reduce the UK’s net tactical air transport capability due to having to rely solely on C-130J aircraft to provide support to operations after the C130K aircraft Out of Service Date in 2012. A series of interim measures has been introduced, including enhancements to the availability of the existing C-130J fleet. A study into the possibility of further extending the life of the existing C-130K fleet concluded that this would not represent good value for money.

The revised forecast A400M In Service Date no longer aligns with the C130K Out of Service Date of 2012. This increases the pressure on existing tactical airlift capability from 2012 to 2015. Interim measures to mitigate this include action to increase the availability of the remaining C130J fleet.
