# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

TERRIER is designed to be a highly mobile, robust and reliable armoured earthmoving vehicle, which will support mobility, counter mobility and survivability throughout the spectrum of conflict. It will be optimised for battlefield preparation and used by Close Support (CS) Engineer units. Terrier is being procured to replace the capability provided by the Combat Engineer Tractors (CET). The programme is currently mid way through its demonstration phase during which one prototype and four demonstrators will be built. These equipments will be used to progressively assure the IPT and customers that Terrier will deliver the capability required. These activities will lead to a production release in 2007. Major milestones for the next 12 months include prototype trials interim results, design reviews for the training aids and Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) of the first demonstrator vehicle. Current issues include integration of Bowman into Terrier and the funding of modifications to the A400M floor. Only the A400M issue, however, could affect Terrier’s Key User Requirements.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

A funded feasibility study for Terrier concluded that the most cost-effective way of meeting the requirement was to develop a new vehicle integrating, where possible, in-service sub-systems and commercial off-the-shelf equipment. Approval was given for a competitive Project Definition phase in August 1998 and Firm Price contracts were placed in August 1999 with BAE Systems (with the work undertaken by its subsidiary Royal Ordnance PLC) and Vickers Defence Systems. Both contractors developed detailed designs making extensive use of Computer Aided Design tools, virtual reality modelling, rigs and trials. The capabilities required and constraints imposed by physical limitations, such as rail and air transportability, resulted in very similar technical solutions. Both contractors offered tracked vehicles close in size, weight and mobility to Warrior, having a crew of two and providing protection against small arms, high explosive fragments and mines. An Invitation to Tender (ITT) was issued in February 2001 to both companies which sought detailed proposals and prices for all later phases. The ITT also adopted Smart Acquisition initiatives such as Progressive Acceptance and innovative Contractor Logistic Support proposals. The Main Gate Business Case was approved on 17 July 2002. The contract for Demonstration, Manufacture and Phase 1 Contractor Logistic Support was placed with Royal Ordnance PLC on 19 July 2002.
