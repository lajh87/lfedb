# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

To maintain a naval reactor Core Production Capability (CPC) to support the UK’s nuclear submarine flotilla. All Royal Navy submarine propulsion nuclear reactor cores have been manufactured at the RollsRoyce (RR) Raynesway site.

To conduct nuclear operations on the Raynesway Site, Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations Limited is

‘Licensed’ formally by the Health and Safety Executive (Office for Nuclear Regulation) as required by the Nuclear Installations Act. As the nuclear site licensee, Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations Limited has a legal requirement to undertake a Periodic Review of Safety every 10 years, with the last review completing in 2012. The Periodic Review of Safety requires the Licensee to review the activities conducted on the site and the hazards arising from them and compare with relevant good practice. The 2002 Periodic Review of Safety identified that the current facilities, constructed in the late 1950s have a number of shortcomings against relevant good nuclear and environmental standards. The continuation of nuclear operations to support the submarine programme post 2012 requires capital investment to meet the latest standards.

The technological and manufacturing capability to produce submarine reactor cores has traditionally been sustained through successive contracts for their production. With the introduction of long life cores and the reduction in the submarine flotilla size the numerical requirement for cores has reduced.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) White Paper deferred the In-Service Date (ISD) for the Successor SSBN to 2028 with a 36 month drumbeat.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

In September 2007, the Investment Appraisals Board approved the CPC Initial Gate Business Case, to down select to the phased regeneration of the Rolls-Royce Raynesway Site, as the most cost effective way of delivering the capability.

Prior to Main Gate Contract being awarded, two Review Notes were approved to continue the Assessment Phase and enable the Department to explore other more advantageous commercial arrangements.

In 2010 it became apparent that several stakeholders, including HM Treasury, required a more detailed review of the options to refurbish the current facilities to establish whether it offered improved value for money. This led to Director Submarines directing a study into the viability of refurbishing the current facilities to meet the CPC requirements and formally presenting this as an option for Main Gate.

The Assessment Phase contract was let on 13th February 2008. This contract covered Assessment Phase work up to February 2010.

The Interim Contract was placed on 4th February 2010 to cover the work required to complete Assessment Phase activities up to placement of the Main Phase Contract on 23rd April 2012.

In January 2012 the IAC approved the Review Note requesting release of funding against the Main Gate Business Case. The advanced funding was required to maintain capability and continuation of the programme i.e. Sustainment.

During the Assessment Phase of the CPC project, Rolls-Royce Power Engineering have continued to produce nuclear cores for the Astute Class Ship Submersible Nuclear (SSN).

## A.3. Project History

April 2012: HMT approved the CPC Main Gate Business Case.

April 2012: Placement of the main phase CPC Contract. The scope includes the full regeneration of CPC and Sustainment of capability to March 2023 and production and delivery of 2 cores.

May 2012: IAC approval of Main Gate Business Case.

The CPC contract includes the delivery of 2 cores (H12 \[Astute Boat 7\] and J1 \[Successor Boat 1\]). Approval for J1 is included within the CPC Main Gate Business Case and H12 is included within the Astute Submarine Programme Approval of Aug 2011.

\\\

May 2012 to January 2013: Construction Contract tender evaluation.

November 2012: Following the Licensed Site Periodic Safety Review (PSR), The Health and Safety Executive’s Office for Nuclear Regulation concluded that normal operation of the Licensed Site can continue whilst a programme of work to implement a number of improvements is progressed.

December 2012: Rolls-Royce place Contract with sub-contractor CH2MHILL to provide the project support.

January 2013: Rolls-Royce place contract for construction with Graham Construction. Work commenced on site. The demolition of Nuclear Manufacturing Services was completed in January 2013 in preparation for the start of Phase 1.

March 2013: Demolition of the Operations Management Centre was completed.

March 2013: Contract amendment to bring H11 under CPC from the core batch buy contract.

May 2013: Manufacturing Facility 1st Build (MF1B) piling commenced.

Cores have been delivered in-year to support the submarine programme.

## A.4. In-Year Progress

May 2013: Reactor core \\\ development for Successor (SSBN) explicitly included in CPC J Core development.

July 2013: Piling of the Energy Centre and Reception Centre was completed.

August 2013: Piling of MF1B was completed.

October 2013: Steel frame erected for the Energy Centre.

\\\

December 2013: Steel frame erected for the Reception Centre.

March 2014: Steel frame work erected for MF1B.

6^th^ March 2014: The Secretary of State for Defence made a statement to Parliament announcing his decision to refuel HMS Vanguard in 2015, following the detection of low level radiation in the cooling water of the prototype core at the NRTE. \\\

## A.5. Capability Risks

Delivery of the CPC project is essential in order to maintain the capability to manufacture nuclear reactor cores for the submarine programme and support development work on the Successor core design and manufacturing processes.

The CPC project will maintain the Nuclear site Licence and essential manufacturing and engineering skills; these would require significant time and cost to recover and therefore represent an intolerable risk to the Successor Deterrent core production schedule and subsequent in-service date.

In May 2012, the Investment Approvals Committee approved £1,190 million as the cost of the D&M phase. This includes £14 million which was subsequently advanced into the Assessment Phase in order to continue the programme whilst contract negotiations were finalised and has been accounted for as a cost to the Assessment Phase.
