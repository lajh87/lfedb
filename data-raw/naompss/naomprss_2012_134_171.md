# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

Falcon will provide the comprehensive deployable communication systems that are needed at all levels of command and will operate in conjunction with systems such as Bowman, Cormorant, Skynet 5 and with allies’ communication and information systems. It will not duplicate the capability of existing systems, but will be the high capacity system that binds together tactical communications in a theatre of operations as an integral part of the plans for Networked Enabled Capability. Falcon will replace, incrementally, a number of current systems, in particular Ptarmigan and RAF Transportable Telecommunications System/Deployable Local Area Network.

The programme comprises a number of increments of which Increments A and C of the equipment programme and the Urgent Operational Requirement / Urgent Defence Requirement (Increment H) are reflected in MPR. Increment A will provide a tactical formation level secure communication system for the High Readiness Force (Land) and the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. It will enable units to be deployed rapidly to areas of crisis, thereby allowing the UK to remain a pivotal member of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. The system will be modular and upgradeable, incorporating much off the shelf technology that will ease management of obsolescence throughout its service life. Increment C, providing capability for Royal Air Force deployed operating bases, is the same equipment as contracted under Falcon Increment A. Falcon Increment A will require significantly less manpower to operate than the system being replaced.

In addition, during 2009 project Falcon was selected as the preferred solution to meet the requirements of the deployed technical architecture in Afghanistan, replacing in theatre communication systems. This requirement led to a contract amendment to incorporate system modifications essential for the operation in Afghanistan.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

Increment A of the Falcon programme gained Initial Gate approval in July 2002, following an extended Concept Phase that considered two key options: buy off the shelf technology (Bowman and Cormorant) or buy new capability. It was concluded that a new capability was required.

Marconi Selenia (now Selex) and BAE Systems Insyte were selected for the 15 month Assessment

Phase contract and to compete for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase prime contract for Increment A. The Assessment Phase contracts concentrated on reducing the risk in the proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture phase, including demonstration of components and subsystems to achieve an acceptable, affordable, low risk solution. In addition, Whole Life Cost estimates were refined. Bidders’ proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture phase were submitted on 31 March 2004.

The procurement strategy endorsed at Initial Gate comprised four increments: Increment A provided for High Readiness Force (Land) and the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps; Increment B for UK divisions and brigades under armour; Increment C for Royal Air Force deployed operational bases; and Increment D for littoral warfare and deep support, including higher mobility. Increment D was then an unfunded aspiration.

During the later stages of the Assessment Phase in 2004/2005, a savings option removed funding from the first two years of the Demonstration and Manufacture phase, resulting in a review of the incremental procurement strategy. Two options were considered. The first was for a single programme that effectively would have combined all three funded increments. This would have necessitated the project returning to pre-Initial Gate status and delayed the In Service Date by up to four years. This option was adopted as the planning assumption and reflected in MPR 2005. The second option was for the delivery of “early capability” that would provide for one medium scale deployment by 2010. It would utilise the savings option funding profile and exploit the existing contractor bids for Increment A. This option was explored and found to be viable.

In July 2005, approval was given to the further in-depth exploration of the second option and the selection of BAE Systems Insyte as the preferred bidder for Falcon Increment A. A programme was developed in conjunction with the preferred bidder that was affordable within the available funding.

Falcon Increment C achieved Main Gate approval in July 2007 and was added as a Falcon Increment A contract amendment in September 2007.

# A.3 Project History since Main Gate

Following Main Gate approval for Increment A in March 2006, the Demonstration and Manufacture contract was awarded to BAE Systems Insyte. This contract was added to in September 2007, introducing Increment C, and again in April 2010 incorporating modifications to support the Deployed Technical Architecture (In Theatre Communications Network). The system has been developed to a high degree of maturity and the system validation and verification process is nearing completion, but there have been delays to the voice telephony sub-system and the cryptographic sub-system, which have had a consequential delay to the whole contract. The Equipment Acceptance Trial, a key milestone in the system’s development, was completed successfully and reported as a pass with caveats in November 2009. Further, a Technical Field Evaluation of the system was successfully conducted in July 2010. Falcon Phase 2, which is in the early concept stage and is thus not covered by the MPR, is subject to a financial planning round 2012 Options which seek to reduce capability and funding in future years.

<th>Falcon had been experiencing difficulties since Quarter 3 2010 when it was identified that technical issues with the cryptographic subsystem meant that the project was subject to a series of senior management reviews. The development issue with the crypto was the sole contributory factor to the delay of the Falcon programme. A 2-Star Programme Review to get Falcon back on track took place on the 17th May 2011 led by Director Information Systems and Services. In attendance were senior stakeholders in Industry, user and customer communities and Government Communications Head Quarters focused on resolving the issue. As a result, an Integrated Baseline Review was conducted; Part 1 during the period 13-17 June 2011 with a follow up Part 2 conducted in September 2011 with the contractor. Part 1 focussed on scope, scheduling, resourcing and risk as follows.
<ul>
<li>Determining whether the remaining scope of work was clearly understood and agreed by the Authority.</li>
<li>Evaluating whether the Project Schedule(s) to deliver the remaining scope of work was sufficiently robust and reflected a realistic resource position and could be used as the basis for establishing the revised Baseline and measuring success.</li>
<li>Providing confidence to the Authority that the Project Risk &amp;
Opportunity Management Process was being followed so that the resultant schedule of work included due cognisance of the Project’s risks, opportunities and uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
Part 2 focused on confirming the Performance Measurement Baseline had been established and that Earned Value Management Reviews and Reporting were operating effectively. An Information Note was raised in June 2011 informing the Investment Approvals Committee of the delay to the programme. In addition due to the delay to the programme, Falcon was invited to attend the inaugural Major Projects Review Board conducted by Chief Defence Materiel and Secretary of State for Defence in June 2011. Following the review, Chief Defence Materiel communicated with industry that continued lack of performance could result in contract cancellation. The programme re-presented at the next Major Project Review Board in September 2011 reporting that the cryptographic problems had been resolved and the programme was now back on track. An action was placed indicating Falcon would again be reviewed at the next Major Projects Review Board in December 2011. A Review Note was raised for timescale only in November 2011 to reset the In Service Date for Increments A and C plus the UOR. The programme slippage was a total of 19 months from previous approval. The revised dates were reset to December 2012 (at 50%) for Increments A and C, and UOR Equipment Delivery Date of March 2013 (at 90%). These dates were approved in December 2011.</th>

# A.5 Capability Risks

Falcon Increment A and Increment C will deliver secure one-to-one voice and wideband data networks to deployed forces, including Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, Divisional and Brigade

Headquarters and unit level command posts and Deployed Operating Bases. Without this capability Land and Air Forces will be unable to execute effective command and control. In addition, Falcon Increment A and Increment C will also provide wideband data coverage for vital intelligence gathering platforms such as

Enter Text HereAirborne Stand Off Radar, Land Environment Air Picture Provision and Watchkeeper. Without the wideband data network delivered under Falcon this intelligence information will not be delivered to the key decision makers in a timely fashion. Falcon Increment C will also support the increased data requirements of new aircraft such as Typhoon and will allow them to operate from Deployed Operating Bases.
