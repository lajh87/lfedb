<th>The Warrior Armoured Fighting Vehicle was brought into service in 1988 with an Out of Service Date of 2025. The requirement for the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme is to sustain the capability of the Armoured Infantry within the balanced force against current and emerging threats, across the spectrum of conflict until the Warrior Out of Service Date. The Warrior Armoured Fighting Vehicle was brought into service in 1988 with an Out of Service Date of 2025. The Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme consists of four main elements:
1. Warrior Fightability Lethality Improvement Programme (A new turret incorporating a fully stabilised automatic 40mm cannon) The 40 mm Cased Telescopic Cannon and Ammunition System has been mandated as the weapon system for Warrior and procured by a joint Anglo-French project. The project is currently part way through qualification of the ammunition and cannon, concurrently the weapon system is being integrated into Warrior by Lockheed Martin UK, who will qualify the new turret.

<li>Enhanced Electronic Architecture</li>
</ol>
(Power generation and distribution enhancement and the introduction of a modern electronic architecture)
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Modular Protection System</li>
</ol>
(Applique Armour fixing points, enabling a 'tailored' armour solution to counter specific threats)
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle</li>
</ol>
(A new variant, replacing obsolescent platforms, that has equal protection and mobility to the core fighting platforms). Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle is currently in the Concept Phase and is subject to future approval. The current affordable fleet is 565 vehicles of which 445 are currently planned to be upgraded through the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme.</th>

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Assessment Phase was conducted from the approval of Initial Gate (27th July 2009) to the contract effective date of 31st October 2011. A competition was run, with two bidders (BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin) invited to compete.

After Initial Gate, the programme was given a compressed timeline of six months to gain Main Gate Approval, and a Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approval Board in February 2010. Affordability issues due to an over extended Defence Budget meant Main Gate Approval was not given, with the bidders requested to Revise and Confirm their bids against a range of options. In March 2010 the Investment Approvals Board approved an uplift of up £12.4m to fund the extended Assement Phase.

The programme team resubmitted a Main Gate Business Case to the Defence Equipment and Support

Investment Board on 11th July 2011, which was approved and submitted for the Investment and Approval Committee meeting on 19th July 2011. Approval was given by Her Majesty's Treasury on 4th October 2011 and then the Investment and Approvals Committee on 10th October 2011.

The Prime Minister visited the Lockheed Martin facility in Ampthill, Bedfordshire on 25th October 2011 and made a public announcement regarding the placement of the contract with Lockheed Martin.

The Contract for the Demonstration Phase was signed on 31st October 2011.

Within the Warrior approval, the 40mm Cannon was the mandated weapon system (March 2008) which would enable commonality with the Specialist Vehicles Programme, thus benefitting from common ammunition and training. A Review Note for the 40mm Cannon went to the Investment Approvals Board in March 2010 and was approved in April 2010.

<th>The Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme is currently in month five of a five year Demonstration phase contract, with an option to proceed to Manufacture. Since Contract Award, the Prime Contractor has mainly focused on buiding their delivery team. The Programme Measurement Baseline (which includes the Integrated Master Schedule, the Work Breakdown Structure and the Organisational Breakdown Structure) was completed and signed off on 10th February 2012. A System Requirements Review was conducted on 28th February 2012. The Integrated Baseline Review will be conducted on 30th April 2012. Joint Battlefield Training and Synthetic Environment Team have placed an Expression of Interest in a Commercial journal for the Warrior Training Solution.</th>

# A.5 Capability Risks

Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme will upgrade the current Warrior fleet, some of which have been upgraded through a series of modifications and Urgent Operational Requirements. The current fleet is now restricted in it's capability on operations due to lack of growth in its electronic architecture and inability to fire on the move and the lethality of the existing 30mm weapon.The Out of Service Date for the Warrior fleet is 2025, so Warrior must be upgraded to avoid a long-term capability gap opening up.

Repair of equipment and supply of spares for the current Warrior fleet is provided through contracts with industry placed by Civil Servants employed by Defence Equipment and Support and Defence Support Group. A number of significant support contracts exist, with major examples being with Thales Optronics Ltd for the Battle Group Thermal Imager sights and a contract for the Diesel Engines and Transmission with Caterpillar Ltd. The support strategy for the upgraded Warrior will be similar to the current fleet. There will be an initial purchase of Capital Spares through the Manufacture contract to support the upgraded Warrior for a period of two years.
