# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

The ‘C’ class vehicle fleet comprises of over 4000 items of 100 major types such as rough terrain earthmoving equipment, specialist engineer construction plant as well as field material handling equipment. These are held at varying degrees of military readiness and are capable of undertaking a wide range of combat support, logistic and construction tasks. The drive for the project has been to deliver the capability through a PFI service because of the commercial nature of the fleet.

The contract was signed on 10 June 2005 with the Amey Lex Consortium (ALC). ALC and MOD are now engaged in a period of implementation during which the service is gradually rolled-out by ALC to units on a geographical basis. To achieve full service ALC must demonstrate readiness and satisfactory service during six distinct phases. The first four of these phases have been successfully completed and In Service Date was declared on 31 March 2006 one month ahead of the approved ISD. The roll-out of the service to units began in December 2005 with successful completion of the Pilot Phase in eastern United Kingdom and will culminate in the final phase with provision of the service to remaining units in Canada, Cyprus and those on operations. To ensure confidence that an operational service can be met ALC have taken part in and successfully passed, a live operational scenario.

Once implementation has concluded, management of the 15 year project will transfer to the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) under the control of Engineer Systems Support Integrated Project Team (ESS IPT).

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Initial Gate approval was granted in November 2000 based on Pre-Qualification Questionnaire documentation from six consortia. Three short-listed contenders were chosen to receive the Invitation to Negotiate (ITN), released in March 2001. Throughout this period a process called ‘convergence’ was used to acquaint industry with the requirement and also to gain feedback on alternative solutions. The ITN responses were assessed against specified criteria. At this time, the three contenders reduced to two, as two bidders combined teams to propose a consolidated bid. A further round of Revise and Confirm offers were requested in May 2002, with responses from the two consortia (Amey Lex Consortia; FastEx) in June 2002.

The evaluation of the two bids (ALC and FastEx) against the Public Sector Comparator was completed in early 2003 before final submission of the Main Gate Business Case to the Investment Approvals Board in March 2003. Whilst awaiting the IAB and Ministerial decision, no interaction could take place with the bidders, however, specific elements of the requirement were reviewed to address any inconsistencies and implement additional risk reduction measures. This process led to the revised Preferred Bidder documentation published in December 2003. At the time of announcing the Main Gate decision to proceed with ALC, it was also recognised that a funding gap had been created by the constraint placed on the use of Indirect RDEL (non-cash) by HM Treasury. The funding requirements were addressed with ALC as the initial part of the contract negotiations and with the Directors Equipment Capability (Ground Manoeuvre) and (Expeditionary Logistics and Support) in EP05 Phase 1.
