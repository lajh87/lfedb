# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

Indirect Fire Precision Attack will provide, by incremental acquisition, a suite of munitions for indirect precision attack of static, mobile, and manoeuvring targets extending to ranges in excess of 150 kilometres.

The capability required under Indirect Fire Precision Attack will be delivered through a structured programme of Assessment, Demonstration and Manufacturing phases. To support the incremental nature of the programme an overarching Assessment Phase provided the evidence to support decisions on individual components via a series of Main Gate (or similar) Business Cases.

The Assessment Phase indicated that the Indirect Fire Precision Attack capability is likely to be achieved by a mixture of guided rockets, enhanced artillery shells and Loitering Munitions. They will carry a variety of payloads. Indirect Fire Precision Attack munitions will make use of a number of in-service platforms such as the Multiple Launch Rocket System and the AS90 self-propelled howitzer. The Loitering Munition early capability does not include a platform although the munitions are trailer mounted. Integration into a platform could be part of later Blocks (variants). The mix of munitions procured under the programme will have a range of In-Service dates: this multi-solution approach is being managed through an incremental procurement strategy.

The Main Gate Business Case for the first component, a 155mm Ballistic Sensor Fuzed Munition, was

^Enter\ Text\ Here^approved in July 2007 with a target In-Service Date of September 2011. Cancellation of this programme was approved by the Investment Approvals Board on 21 December 2009. This was as a result of technical difficulties resulting in the Contractor being unable to achieve an acceptable level of technology maturity within the approved time and cost boundaries.

The second component is the Loitering Munition. Loitering Munitions can be launched in response to an identified target but can also be flown to re-programmable locations and maintained in a holding pattern until given a target. They are controlled by an operator who will have a real-time image of the intended target and surrounding area providing the ability to control the exact time, attitude and direction of the attack of a static, re-locatable or moving target, including providing a contribution to the formal target identification and confirmation process.

The remaining components identified in the Assessment Phase were Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), Guided Shell and Large Long Range Rocket.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Initial Gate Business Case for Indirect Fire Precision Attack was approved in May 2001. Following competition using a Capability Based Questionnaire, an Assessment Phase contract was awarded in May 2002 to a consortium of companies led by BAE Systems Strategic Capability Solutions (formerly known as BAE Systems Future Systems). The first Indirect Fire Precision Attack Assessment Phase was designed to provide, and iteratively update, a 'Route Map' to achieving the full Indirect Fire Precision Attack capability with recommendations about the type, quantities and mix of munitions. In line with the approved strategy for an incremental programme, a series of Assessment Phases are planned, each being approved by a separate Review Note. A contract for the second Assessment Phase was placed with the BAE Systems led consortium in January 2007. This included the Loitering Munition Capability Demonstration programme, which completed in December 2008. The BAE Systems led Assessment Phase contract completed in mid April 2010.

In light of the incremental procurement strategy, procurement of components will be approved via a series of Main Gate Business Cases. After each component receives a Main Gate approval, it will be managed as a separate programme in its own right. However, each capability will continue to be included in the ongoing operational analysis work, so that the overall mix and quantity of munitions to be procured can be refined as the programme progresses.

A contract for the Demonstration and Manufacture of the first component, Ballistic Sensor Fuzed Munition, was placed with Gesellschaft für Intelligente Wirksysteme GmbH in September 2007 and terminated in February 2010.

The Loitering Munition procurement strategy deviates from the above process in that approval is being sought as part of the Complex Weapons Programme. The capabilities/quantities of this munition are therefore additionally assessed in their contribution to the Complex Weapons portfolio.

<th>Approval for the cancellation of Ballistic Sensor Fuzed Munition was granted by the Investment Approvals Board on 21 December 2009 and the contract was terminated in February 2010. The Demonstration and Manufacture phase for Loitering Munition was approved by the Investment Approvals Board in March 2010 as part of the Complex Weapons Interim Main Gate 1 submission. It is intended that this will be demonstrated on current operations in 2012. Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System has a proposed first delivery date of June 2018. Guided Shell has had its funding deleted in Planning Round 2011;
however, the planned capability requirement remains. The Large Long Range Rocket capability was deleted in Planning Round 2011. The Loitering Munition Capability Demonstration was transferred to the Royal School of Artillery during 2010. The system will be used for training purposes only.</th>

# A.4 Capability Risks

The impact of not having Indirect Fire Precision Attack is that the Land Component would not have independent capability to attack with precision, targets beyond the range of direct fire weapons such as tanks and anti-tank guided weapons. In this respect Attack Helicopters are considered as direct fire weapons as the helicopter crew have to be able to see the target. This means that the indirect fire systems can only suppress or neutralise enemy forces beyond the range of direct fire weapons by using un-guided munitions. This results in large wastage and a collateral damage risk which must be reduced.

Two key benefits of Indirect Fire Precision Attack are the ability to destroy targets that UK forces could previously only suppress and that UK forces can do so with no or minimal collateral damage. That Indirect Fire Precision Attack is fully controlled by the Land Component is important because of the persistence and responsiveness of its own capabilities. Whilst aircraft can deliver precision weapons against targets beyond the range of direct fire weapons they lack persistence and are generally not responsive; they have to be preplanned or booked and can only stay on the station for a short period.
