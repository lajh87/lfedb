# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The requirement for the Queen Elizabeth Class was endorsed in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review which identified a continuing need for rapidly deployable forces with the reach and self-sufficiency to act independently of host-nation support. The Strategic Defence Review concluded that the ability to deploy offensive air power would be central to future force projection operations, with carriers able to operate the largest possible range of aircraft in the widest possible range of roles. This analysis was further endorsed by the New Chapter work of 2002 and the Defence White Paper in December 2003. The current Invincible Class of carriers was designed for Cold War Anti-Submarine Warfare operations. With helicopters and a limited air defence capability provided by a relatively small number of embarked Sea Harriers, it was judged that this capability would no longer meet future United Kingdom requirements. It was therefore decided to replace the Invincible Class with two larger and more capable aircraft carriers. The class’s offensive air power will be provided primarily by the Joint Combat Aircraft. The Tailored Air Group is an air group comprising a mix of aircraft, tailored to the mission need; it will typically consist of both fixed and rotary-winged aircraft including joint air assets e.g. Joint Combat Aircraft.

The Strategic Defence & Security Review confirmed the requirement for a Carrier Strike capability as part of MOD’s Future Force 2020. In order to deliver overall savings to Defence, it concluded that the Carrier Strike component would be based around the Carrier Variant of the Joint Strike Fighter which would fly from an operational Queen Elizabeth Class carrier converted to a Carrier Variant configuration (fitted with catapults and arrestor gear). The Strategic Defence & Security Review confirmed that both carriers should be built, with one to be operational and the second kept in extended readiness or sold. Following concerns over the escalating cost of the catapults and arrestor gear, in May 2012 the decision was made to revert back to a Short Take Off and Landing solution for both ships in Class. The decision to run one operational carrier and keep one in extended readiness was retained, a decision that is to be reviewed in Strategic Defence & Security Review 2015, within the context of the PM’s announcement at the NATO Summit in September 2014 that HMS PRINCE OF WALES will also be brought into service ensuring one carrier available, 100% of the time. The current schedule will see the first in class (HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH) Vessel Acceptance in 2017, First of Class Lightning II Flying Trails in 2018, which if successful will lead to Carrier Strike Initial Operating Capability declaration in 2020.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

1998: The Class received Initial Gate approval in December 1998 and Invitations to Tender were issued in January 1999. Following tender evaluation, competitive firm price contracts for the Assessment Phase, each potentially worth some £30m, were awarded to BAE Systems and Thales UK in November 1999. The Assessment Phase was broken down into two stages. The first involved the examination of several carrier designs, and helped inform the decision in January 2001 to select the United States Joint Strike Fighter as the option with best potential to meet the Joint Combat Aircraft requirement. Stage 1 completed in June 2001, following which proposals from the contractors for Stage 2 were considered, together with an assessment of their views on the level of work needed to adequately de-risk the programme. After careful consideration, the conclusion was reached that the original two-stage approach no longer offered value for money and the Assessment Phase strategy was changed.

2002: The competitive second stage was revised and shortened (completing in November 2002) and enabled the competing contractors to concentrate on refining their designs and taking key trade-off decisions. An innovative Continuous Assessment process was used throughout to evaluate the contractors' performance which led to the conclusion that an alliance approach involving BAE Systems, Thales UK and the Department represented the best approach to Future Aircraft Carrier. The innovative Alliance procurement strategy enabled the full exploitation of the resources and strengths of the alliance participants with the shared objective of improving on agreed performance targets and was announced in January 2003. A third stage of assessment was therefore taken forward on this basis to further increase the maturity of the design and determine the alliancing strategy for Future Aircraft Carrier. Stage 3 completed in March 2004.

2004: In July 2004, the Assessment Phase was extended into Stage 4 to further mature the design and carry out risk reduction work, to ensure that the best technical & procurement solution was achieved. Alliancing principles were agreed with BAE Systems and Thales UK and further developed with the selection in February 2005 of Kellogg, Brown
& Root UK Ltd as an additional participant in the Alliance. The timescale for completing the design and risk reduction work was further extended in August 2005

(into Stage 5) although this did not result in any additional cost to the programme. The Assessment Phase completed at the end of January 2006 and was finalised in November 2010, on receipt of Final Cost Certificates, at a revised total cost of £288M.

## A.3. Project History

2005: Following direction from the Investment Approvals Board, the project has adopted an incremental approach to Main Gate approval with the Demonstration and Manufacturing Phases being divided into two sequential Main Gate approval points. The first phase (Demonstration), which included expanding the alliance to include Babcock Engineering Services and VT Shipbuilding, was approved by the Investment Approvals Board and Treasury in December 2005. The total cost of the Demonstration Phase (excluding

Indirect Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit, but including non-recoverable VAT) was approved at £297M (not to exceed).

2006: In March 2006, the UK agreed a Memorandum of Understanding that provides for the supply to France of a common baseline design data pack to enable French industry to bid for the design, manufacture and support of one Future Aircraft Carrier (France). France has paid an initial entry fee and contributed to the costs of the UK Demonstration Phase.

2007: At the time of the Main Gate in 2007, the build strategy called for one of the Lower Blocks to be constructed at the BAE Systems Submarines yard in Barrow-In-Furness. BAE Systems needed to build a new facility - the Central Assembly Shop - in order to accommodate the construction of the block. It was envisaged at the time that the facility would also be beneficial to the future submarine programme. MOD authorised BAE Systems to begin site work in June 2007. In February 2009 the Alliance Management Board agreed to a revised build strategy reallocating LB03 to BVT Clyde therefore terminating the contract with BAE Systems. It was hoped that the work carried out in Barrow would be of use to the future submarine programme; however this did not come to fruition which led to a write-off of £8m in Financial Year 2009-10.

2008: The Demonstration Phase activity completed in mid-2008 with total expenditure to 31st March 2011 of £266M. The second and final Main Gate approval, to proceed with the Manufacturing Phase of the project was announced by Secretary of State on 25th July 2007 at a not to exceed cost of £3900M including the capitalised Assessment Phase costs and Demonstration Phase costs.

Following Main Gate approval the project moved into the Engineering Transition Phase, an extension of the Demonstration Phase to encompass the period prior to contract signature. On 3rd July 2008 a contract was signed with BVT Surface Fleet for the manufacture of the two carriers together with signature of an Alliance Agreement with all members of the alliance.

On 11 December 2008, Ministers announced the outcome of MOD’s Equipment Examination including the intention to re-profile the Queen Elizabeth Class project to meet near term priorities and improve the scope of alignment with the Joint Combat Aircraft programme. The re-profiling measure removed £450M from the next four years and delayed In-Service Dates of the two carriers by 1 and 2 years respectively. The cost estimates of the impact of the Examination on the project were approved by the MOD in February 2010.

2009: The first cut of steel took place in July 2009 at the Govan shipyard in Glasgow, and manufacture subsequently conducted in six UK shipyards: Babcock Rosyth and Appledore, BAE System Surface Ships, Govan, Portsmouth, Cammell Laird Birkenhead and A&P Tyne.

In 2009 a number of significant milestones were achieved: completion of No.1 dock at Rosyth; delivery of an upper deck section from Appledore to Rosyth; delivery of the Highly Mechanised Weapon Handling System and the delivery of Emergency Diesel Generators.

The Aircraft Carrier Alliance acknowledged that there was a requirement to reduce costs at the time of contract award on the basis that concerted management action in the early years of the project would allow this to reduce. In the event, the disruption caused by initial recosting activity and then the Equipment Examination prevented successful delivery of the originally planned cost reduction - as this would not be achieved, MOD considered it prudent to formally recognise this in its revised estimate.

2010: During 2010 Diesel Generators were installed in Lower Block 02 (Portsmouth) and in March 2011 in Lower Block 04 (Govan) on HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH. In early 2011, the Goliath Crane, used to assemble the carriers, arrived at Rosyth.

The Investment Approvals Board approved the Queen Elizabeth Class Final Target Cost for the preStrategic Defence & Security Review programme on 31 January 2011 to £5242M. Long-lead equipment’s

<th>for HMS PRINCE OF WALES were ordered, with many of the major components already in-build or delivered (e.g. Diesel Generators). In October 2010, the Strategic Defence &amp; Security Review concluded that one carrier would be fitted with Catapults and Arrestor gear to operate the F35C Carrier Variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. The other carrier would not be converted and placed into Extended Readiness. An 18 month investigation into how best to achieve this formally began in Spring 2011 with assistance from the US. As this work proceeded, it became clear that the cost of conversion, and the time needed, was far greater than initially thought. As a result, it was announced in May 2012 that the carriers would revert to their original Short Take Off and Landing configuration and operate the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter. The National Audit Office has separately examined the 2010 and 2012 decisions. At the close of the Financial Year in March 2010 the bow of the HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH departed from Appledore for Rosyth. 2011: The Goliath Crane was delivered to Rosyth in March 2011. It was assembled and tested over the next two months and was commissioned (ready for use) in June 2011 with steelwork beginning on HMS PRINCE OF WALES’s Lower Block 03 at Govan, with a formal steel cut ceremony held on 26 May 2011. 2012: Lower Block 03 for HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH arrived at Rosyth No.1 Dock in early September 2011 from Govan, with work to join Centre Block 03 (Tyne) to Lower Block 03 later in the month marking the start of the assembly phase on the project. Over the next months, Sponsons 03-06 were attached, with the final Sponson (05) join completing in February 2012. The build of the first carrier made significant progress, with over 50,000 tonnes in the dock at Rosyth. Both gas turbines installed, the forward and aft islands having been lowered into place on the flight deck and the ramp installed. Work on the second carrier increased, with work underway on four Lower Blocks, two Centre Blocks and some of the Sponsons. 2012: In May 2012, the Secretary of State announced the Department's decision to revert to the pre Strategic Defence and Security Review position of operating the Queen Elizabeth Class as a Short TakeOff and Vertical Landing platform. This meant that the Carrier Development Phase work - the activity to investigation options to convert one Carrier to operate the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35C) - was cancelled. The decision to revert resulted in write off of costs accrued up to 10 May 2012. The estimated write-off costs are not expected to exceed £55M. The Aircraft Carrier Alliance formally began rebaselining the QEC programme in July 2012 and provided their initial findings to the MOD-Chaired Alliance Management Board (AMB) in November 2012. Faced with a significant level of cost growth, MOD began detailed discussions with the ACA, with the aim of rebalancing the risk/reward mechanism. These discussions continued throughout the first half of 2013, culminating in a formal proposal from the ACA on 19 July 2013. On receipt of this proposal, the MOD Cost Assurance and Analysis Service (CAAS) was commissioned to undertake further investigations, which once again highlighted a series of challenges, or areas where cost could be reduced. MOD 2 and 3 led sessions were convened to ensure appropriate rigour had been applied in reviewing the ACA proposal and to agree resolution. Through this mechanism some £252M of costs were driven out prior to final negotiations. During the negotiations in late October 2013, a further reduction to the target cost of £96M was agreed, resulting in a total cost reduction of £348M compared to the ACA's July 2013 proposal position. Subsequently, a Heads of Terms agreement was signed between MOD and the ACA on 6 November 2013, which set out the commercial principals covering the agreement and work was undertaken to obtain programme re-approval from the MOD Approving Authorities. Following re-approval, a revised contract was signed . At the industrial level, the revised QEC programme underpins the wider agreement reached with BAES on the future of UK shipbuilding announced by the Secretary of State on 6 November 2013. 2014: The external structure of HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH has been completed, consisting of over 55,000 tonnes of metal work and systems. In January 2014, the supports surrounding the ramp were removed, the forward and aft aircraft lifts were fitted (February and May 2014 respectively) and the Pole Mast was installed on the Aft Island. On the second carrier, HMS PRINCE OF WALES, work is underway on all of the main blocks and assembly is expected to begin in August/September 2014. A revised contract, reflecting a rebaselined programme, was signed on 29 May 2014. This contract places greater incentivisation on Industry to deliver to cost and time, through a revised 50/50 shareline</th>

arrangement. On 4 July 2014, the first ship. HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH, was officially named by Her Majesty the Queen, and on the 17 July 2014 was floated out of the dock. The ship is currently berthed in the non-tidal basin and is undergoing fitting out as part of the test, integration and commissioning phase of her programme.

## A.4. In-Year Progress

Assembly of HMS PRINCE OF WALES began on 9 September 2014 with the double docking of two of the ship’s largest hull sections – Lower Block 02 (6,000 tonnes) and Lower Block 03 (8,000 tonnes). The movement of the blocks into the dock at Rosyth marked the beginning of the ship’s assembly phase and came only days after Prime Minister David Cameron announced at the NATO Summit in Newport that HMS PRINCE OF WALES will enter service with the Royal Navy.

An important milestone was achieved on 24 October 2014 when HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH was supplied with shore-based High Voltage (HV) electricity for the first time. This allows all the systems on-board to be brought to life and tested ahead of autonomous power from the ship’s generators coming on-stream in 2015. Installation of the first MT30 Gas Turbine Alternator (GTA) package into HMS PRINCE OF WALES was successfully completed on 28 February 2015. In March HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH received her first delivery of fuel (500 tonnes), the flushing of the lubrication oil system for the diesels was completed and the first run of the diesel generators is expected to take place at the end of May.

On 28 April 2015 (shortly after 14/15 financial year end) the steel was cut for the final block of HMS PRINCE OF WALES (and, therefore, the Queen Elizabeth Class carriers programme as a whole). All 25 blocks that make up HMS PRINCE OF WALES are now in production. Over 30,000 tonnes are already assembled in the dry dock at Rosyth.

<th>The Class is, together with the Lightning II F35B and Merlin Mk2 CROWSNEST deemed the Carrier Strike Change Programme, an essential element of the Carrier Enabled Power Projection Programme: it exploits the attributes of maritime, air and land forces to deliver or threaten action across three environments. Specifically for Queen Elizabeth Class, the Strategic Defence &amp; Security Review 2010 states 'the Queen Elizabeth Class carrier, operating as part of a Response Force Task Group will be a key basing option for the projection of air and amphibious power in support of national influence and future complex or simple non-enduring intervention operations'. Lightning II Maritime capability depends on the Queen Elizabeth Class to achieve Carrier Strike. Strategic Defence &amp; Security Review 2010 further stated that "The current, limited carrier-strike capability will be retired" because"
short-range Harriers ... would provide only a very limited coercive capability. We judge it unlikely that this would be sufficiently useful in the latter half of the decade to be a cost-effective use of defence resources". This will create a capability gap until a Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carrier has completed integration with the first operational squadron of Lightning II aircraft. Strategic Defence &amp; Security Review 2010 accepted a capability gap in the operation of fixed wing aircraft from 2011 to 2020. This has resulted in a risk to the re-generation of this element of Carrier Enabled Power Projection, which is being addressed by work across multiple Defence Lines of Development, including the analysis of the experience gained from the US and French Navies. In September 2014 The Prime Minister announced at the NATO summit that both Carriers will be brought into service. We await the outcome of Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 before knowing the precise operating position to be followed and then confirmation of the associated funding. Queen Elizabeth Class is not fully funded to deliver the Helicopter Carrying role in support of Littoral Manoeuvre and the design and safety clearance in its amphibious helicopter support capability is currently limited.</th>

The 50% Queen Elizabeth ISD has

been re-aligned to that forecasted

at the May 2014 approval,

reflecting the re-baselined position

agreed with the Aircraft Carrier

Alliance as part of the October2013

agreement, and reporting the 50%

ISD of February 2018 for the first

time. Although this highlights a +2

month variation compared with the

previous ‘pre-deal’ 50% forecast,

the Aircraft Carrier Alliance

continue with efforts to bring the

ISD forward to reflect or better the

IAC’s Target (or ‘Latest

The Equipment Examination introduced a slip in the In Service Date which would have required the extension in the service of HMS ILLUSTRIOUS in order to maintain carrier-strike capability, the Strategic Defence and Security Review stated that "The current, limited carrier-strike capability will be retired" because "short-range Harriers... would provide only a very limited coercive capability. We judge it unlikely that this would be sufficiently useful in the latter half of the decade to be a cost effective use of defence resources". This will create a capability gap until a Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carrier has completed integration with the first operational squadron of Joint Combat Aircraft.

Control delivery programmes and the Initial Approved Plan are agreed. Full Operating Capability will allow Queen Elizabeth Class to have an embarked Joint Force Air Group and a level of capability equivalent to that declared at Main Gate.
