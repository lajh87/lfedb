• Support/Service/PFI - Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 will Replace the Current Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance MK2 as the New Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 will Provide Significantly Enhanced Anti-Submarine and Anti-Surface Warfare Capability Through Improved Aircraft and Sensor Performance, a Greater Degree of System Integration, Better Human Machine Interface Design and a Substantial Improvement in Availability and Supportability.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

In November 1992, the Equipment Approvals Committee Approved a Request for Information Exercise Whereby 17 Companies Were Invited to Provide Responses to the Draft Replacement Maritime Patrol Aircraft Staff Requirement. Following Analysis of the Industry Responses, the Equipment Approvals Committee Endorsed the Requirement and Approved an Invitation to Tender Phase Whereby Four Companies (BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Loral and Dassault) Were Invited to Provide Detailed Technical and Commercial Proposals for an Aircraft to Meet the Endorsed Staff Requirement. Dassault Withdrew from the Competition in January 1996, and Whilst Lockheed Martin and Loral Merged in May 1996, They Maintained the Two Separate Proposals until the Competition Concluded. Following Assessment of These Responses, Selection of BAE Systems’ Nimrod 2000 (Later to be Re-Designated Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4) Offer Was Approved by Equipment Approvals Committee and Ministers in July 1996. This Was the Equivalent of Main Gate Approval.

## A.3. Progress

The Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 Contract for the Design, Development and Production of 21 Aircraft Was Placed with BAE Systems (then BAe) in 1996, Following an International Competition. the Contract Was Re-Negotiated in Mid 1999 and Again in Early 2002 – when the Department Reduced the Number of Aircraft from 21 to 18. Continued Technical and Resource Problems Led to a Further Review of the Programme and in February 2003 the Department Reached an Agreement with BAE Systems to Change the Fixed Price Contract to a Target Cost Incentive Fee Contract for Design and Development, which Included Manufacture of Three Trials Aircraft, and an Option for a Further Fifteen Production Aircraft. Pending Definition of a Satisfactory Design Standard, Series Production Activities Were Limited to Those Activities Vital to the Preservation of the Essential Skill Sets Within BAE Systems and Its Supply Chain. Flight Trials Commenced in August 2004.

In July 2004, Studies Determined that the Capability of the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 Would Enable Maritime Reconnaissance Requirement to be Met with a Fleet of About 12 Aircraft and the Number to be Procured Has Been Reduced Accordingly. a Further Review of the Programme Identified Increased Production Costs and that the in-Service Date for the Capability Would Need to be Delayed in Order to Make the Programme Affordable Within Departmental Funding Constraints. a Business Case Seeking Authorisation of Commitment to Full Production Was Approved in May 2006, and the Contract Was Amended to Re-Introduce the Production Requirements in July 2006. as Part of the Approval Process the Project’s Original Key Requirements Were Redefined and Endorsed as Key User Requirements by the Investment Approval Board and a Revised Definition of the in-Service Date Was Approved. Affordability Issues Identified in Spring 2008 Resulted in a Further Reduction in the Number of Aircraft from 12 to 9. the Initial Gate Business Case for the Assessment Phase of Future Support Was Approved in May 2005, the Main Gate Submission Has Been Delayed by a Re-Evaluation of the Support Options and is Now Expected Late 2009.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance Attack MK4 is Able to Detect, Identify by Class, and Track all Types of Submarines and Surface Vessels, Including Small, High-Speed Contacts, in both Open-Ocean and Littoral Waters. the Aircraft will also be Able to Conduct Maritime Search & Rescue Operations, Including the Detection, Identification and Tracking of Life Rafts and Persons in the Water, and the Co-Ordination of Activities of Other Rescue Assets.

Loss of the Capability Offered by the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance Attack MK4 Would Have an Adverse Effect on the Protection of the Strategic Nuclear Deterrent, the Provision of which is One of the Ministry of Defence’s Standing Strategic Tasks. in Addition, the Maintenance of the Integrity of the UK Through Detection of Hostile Air and Sea Craft Would be Compromised.

## A.7. Support Strategy

The Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance Attack MK4 Future Support Strategy Was Originally Based on the Establishment of a Weapon System Availability Contract. However, in Order to Reduce Cost and Mitigate Risk, Work is Now in Hand to Develop an Incremental Approach to Implementing an Availability Based Contract.

In Light of the above Change in Strategy, the Approvals Plan for Maritime Reconnaissance Attack MK4 Future Support Main Gate Was Revised in Early 2009 to Reflect the Need to Implement Two Continuity Contracts Deemed Necessary to Protect ISD While the Support Strategy is Redefined and Costed.

The Initial Continuity Contract (Continuity Phase 1) Was Placed in January 2009 and is Due to Complete at the End of June 2009. the Scope of the Continuity Phase 1 Contract Covers the Development and Implementation of the Support Capability Required to Ensure Readiness to Support the First Aircraft Delivery and also Protect the Programme for the Maritime Reconnaissance Attack MK4 in-Service Date. in Essence, the Scope of the Continuity Phase 1contract Represents a Continuation of Essential Support Capability Build-Up Activities Covered under the Preceding Initial Support Capability Services and Long Lead Time Support Activities Contracts. the Activities Concerned Primarily Relate to the Preparation of Facilities, the Implementation of Information Systems, the Production of Processes and Procedures, and the Recruitment and Training of Personnel.

^1^ Originally Let as a Fixed Price Contract.

The Second Continuity Contract (Continuity Phase 2) is Intended to Cover the Period July 2009 to January 2010 and will be Designed to Protect ISD Essential Activities that are on the Path Towards the Implementation and Operation of the Revised Support Strategy. During the Period of Continuity Phase 2, the Main Gate Business Case for the Future Support Programme will be Submitted with the Aim of Securing Approval to Place the Initial in-Service Support Contract in Early 2010.

The Consequence of the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 ISD Slip is that Either the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance MK2 Would Remain in Service Beyond the Current Out-of-Service Date of March 2011 or a Capability Gap will be Endured. This Slip will Delay Introduction of the Improved Capability of the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 and Could Require the Ageing Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance MK2 Fleet to be Maintained in Service Longer than Expected. the Operational Impact of this Slippage will be Partly Mitigated by Measures Already in Hand to Introduce Upgrades to some Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance MK2 Systems.

Performance Against Key Performance Measures

### D.2.2. Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4

Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 is a Legacy Project and Its Original Approval Did not Include Key Requirements. the Key Requirements Reported to Date in the Major Projects Report Were Retrospectively Agreed Between Director of Equipment Capability (Under Water Environment) and Nimrod Integrated Project Team Leader. Before Endorsement Was Sought, it Was Discovered that These Key

Requirements Were not Compliant with the Latest Smart Acquisition Guidelines. Consequently, New Key User Requirements Were Developed from First Principles to Comply with the Latest Guidelines and Endorsed by the Investment Approval Board in June 2006.
