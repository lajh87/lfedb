# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Lynx Wildcat Capability Was Developed to Meet the Requirements for a Dedicated Small Helicopter for Use in both the Land (Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter Requirement) and Maritime (Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft Requirement) Environments to Replace the Current Lynx Fleet which is Reaching Its Life End. Lynx Wildcat is a Single-Source, Combined Helicopter Procurement Programme with Westland Helicopters Ltd which Follows More Effective Contracting Principles. Project Approval is for 80 Aircraft, with Funding for 62 Held by the Integrated Project Team.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

<tr>
<th>initial Gate Approval Was Given in December 2001 for the Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter and in September 2002 for the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft. Following Review under the Future Rotorcraft Programme the Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter Requirement Matured into the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter Requirement. Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter:
The Assessment Phase Benchmarked Westland Helicopter Ltd’s Lynx Wildcat Proposal Against Alternative Offthe-Shelf Solutions from Other Potential Suppliers, and Required the Company to Demonstrate the Necessary Level of Performance to Successfully Deliver the Demonstration
&amp; Manufacture Phase. Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft:
A Single Tender Contract Was Placed with Westland Helicopter Ltd to Develop and De-Risk their Lynx Wildcat Proposal to Meet the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft Requirement in Conjunction with the Approved Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter Programme. Procurement Strategy:
Two Procurement Strategies Were Considered. the First Was to Run a Competition and Second, to Pursue the Westland Helicopter Lynx Wildcat Proposal on a Single Tender Basis - With an Option to Switch from Single Tender to Competition Should the Assessment Phase Indicate that the Lynx Wildcat Solution Was Unlikely to be Cost Effective. the Second Strategy Was the Selected One. the Result of the Assessment Phase Considered the Lynx Wildcat to be the Most Likely of the Options to Deliver the Required Capability by the in-Service Date. This Gave the Benefit of Maintaining Industrial Capability in the UK. Hence a Single Tender Approach Was Judged Most Likely to Offer both the Best Technical Solution and Best Value for Money Overall. the Assessment Phase Successfully De-Risked a Number of Key Requirements, Including Secure Communications, Mission Systems and Engine Certification. Furthermore, Westland Helicopter Ltd’s Super Lynx 300 Export Programme Demonstrated their Capability to Insert New T-800 Engines, Glass Cockpit and Avionics into the Lynx Aircraft.</Th>

## A.3. Progress

Within the Department the Aircraft are to be Known as Wildcat Mk1 (Army Helicopter) and Wildcat Mk1 (Helicopter Maritime Attack).

The Demonstration & Manufacture Contract Was Let in June 2006 to Deliver 70 Aircraft: 40 Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters for the Army and 30 Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft for the Navy with Costed Options for Five more Platforms of Each Type. Preliminary, Interim, Air Vehicle and Air Vehicle & Mission Systems Critical Design Reviews Were Successfully Achieved in January 2007, October 2007, April 2008 and August 2009 Respectively. the First Airframe Was Delivered to the Westland Build Line in November 2008 and a Successful
\`first Flight\` Was Achieved in November 2009 in Accordance with the Schedule Contracted in June 2006. All Three Trials Aircraft are Now Flying Within the Flight Test Programme and Production Aircraft Build Commenced in July 2010. Significant Future Milestones Are: Support &
Training Approval in 2nd Quarter 2011, Delivery of First Production Aircraft to the Army in April 2012. the Equipment Examination (2008) Concluded that Reductions Could be Realised in Procurement Costs if the Quantities Were Reduced to 34 Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters and 28 Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft, with the Impact on Delivered Capability Minimised Through Introducing Design Changes to Achieve Greater Versatility Between the Two Aircraft Variants. the Protracted Period of Uncertainty Surrounding the Project Ended in December 2008 with the

Ministerial Announcement Confirming that the Project Would Proceed to Full Scale Production. a Planning Round 2010 Option Was Run to Addresses the Legislative and Safety Requirement to Fit all Combat Aircraft Including Helicopters with Fuel System Survivability Measures.

Through-Life Training & Support Solutions are to be Developed as Part of the Project. an Information Note Was Approved in July 2007 to Submit the Support Solution Review Note in September 2009. Approval Was also Given for the Training Service Initial Gate Business Case in August 2007 Based on the 4-Stage PFI Treasury Approval Process. While Investigating Alternative Ways to Deliver the Lynx Wildcat Capability During the Equipment Examination, the Opportunity to Deliver Reduced Through Life Costs Was Identified. a Review Note Was Submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in December 2008 and Approved in January 2009, Detailing a New Strategy to Explore a Single Source, Integrated Support Solution and Training Delivery Service Through the Aircraft Manufacturer, AgustaWestland, and Reflects a Revised Recommendation Submission Date to the Investment Approvals Board in Late 2010. the Training Capital Equipment Contract Was Let in February 2011. Due to Challenges in Achieving a Value for Money and Affordable Solution, the Combined Training and Support Service is Now Expected to Proceed to the Investment Approvals Board in the 2nd Quarter of 2011/2012 with a Contract Award to Support the Logistic Support Date. Logistic Support and Ready for Training Dates Remain Unchanged and are Planned for December 2011 and January 2013, Respectively.

Based on the Current Assumptions Within the Rotary Wing Strategy the Quantity of Wildcat Aircraft to be Procured Comprises 34 Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters with a Further 8 Light Assault Helicopter Role Variants of the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter, Together with 28 Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft. the Light Assault Helicopter Role Requirement will be Subject to Appropriate Requirement Approvals. Planning Round 2011 Options Introduce Funding for the Light Assault Helicopter Role Equipment as Well as Descoping the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter Requirement by 4 Aircraft, Resulting in a Total Fleet of 66 Aircraft. a Further Planning Round 2011 Option Was Run to Revise the Profile of the Resources Available for the Wildcat Project Between Financial Year 2014/2015 and Financial Year 2015/2016.

## A.4. Capability Risks

These Projects Provide Ongoing Light Helicopter Capability in the Land, Maritime & Littoral Environments, Beyond the Out of Service Dates of the Current Lynx Helicopter Fleet and Introduce an Enhanced Maritime & Littoral Attack Capability. the Reduction in Aircraft Quantities Arising from the Equipment Examination is Predicated Upon a more Versatile Design Solution Allowing both Aircraft Variants to be Utilised Across a Wider Range of Roles and Environments, but with some Minor Trade-Off Against the Achieved Performance. This will Place a Greater Necessity on the Need to Manage the Two Variants Within a Common in-Service Framework with Commonality Within the Defence Lines of Development.

The April 2011 Reduction of Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters from 34 to 30 will Reduce the Capacity in which to Meet the Requirement for Aviation Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Intelligence Gathering in Land/Littoral Manoeuvre Operations but Remains Sufficient to Meet the Defence Requirement.
