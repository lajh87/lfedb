Number of Projects / Increments 2

Current Status of Projects / Increments

• Post Main Investment Decision – Falcon Increment a

– Falcon Increment C

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Falcon will Provide the Comprehensive Deployable Communication Systems that are Needed at all Levels of Command and will Operate in Conjunction with Systems Such as Bowman, Cormorant, Skynet 5 and with Allies’
Communication and Information Systems. It will not Duplicate the Capability of Existing Systems, but will be the High Capacity System that Binds Together Tactical Communications in a Theatre of Operations as an Integral Part of the Plans for Networked Enabled Capability. Falcon will Replace, Incrementally, a Number of Current Systems, in Particular Ptarmigan and RAF Transportable Telecommunications System/Deployable Local Area Network

The Programme Comprises a Number of Increments of which Only Increments a and C are Reflected in

MPR. Increment a will Provide a Tactical Formation Level Secure Communication System for the High Readiness Force (Land) and the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. It will Enable Units to be Deployed Rapidly to Areas of Crisis, Thereby Allowing the UK to Remain a Pivotal Member of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. the System will be Modular and Upgradeable, Incorporating Much Off the Shelf Technology that will Ease Management of Obsolescence Throughout Its Service Life. Increment C, Providing Capability for Royal Air Force Deployed Operating Bases, is the Same Equipment as Contracted under Falcon Increment A. Falcon Increment a will Require Significantly less Manpower to Operate than the System Being Replaced.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Increment a of the Falcon Programme Gained Initial Gate Approval in July 2002, Following an Extended Concept Phase that Considered Two Key Options: Buy Off the Shelf Technology (Bowman and Cormorant) or Buy New Capability. It Was Concluded that a New Capability Was Required.

Marconi Selenia (Now Selex) and BAE Systems Insyte Were Selected for the 15 Month Assessment

Phase Contract and to Compete for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase Prime Contract for Increment A. the Assessment Phase Contracts Concentrated on Reducing the Risk in the Proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase, Including Demonstration of Components and Subsystems to Achieve an Acceptable, Affordable, Low Risk Solution. in Addition, Whole Life Cost Estimates Were Refined. Bidders’ Proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase Were Submitted on 31 March 2004.

The Procurement Strategy Endorsed at Initial Gate Comprised Four Increments: Increment a Provided for High Readiness Force (Land) and the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps; Increment B for UK Divisions and Brigades under Armour; Increment C for Royal Air Force Deployed Operational Bases; and Increment D for Littoral Warfare and Deep Support, Including Higher Mobility. Increment D Was then an Unfunded Aspiration.

During the Later Stages of the Assessment Phase in 2004/2005, a Savings Option Removed Funding from the First Two Years of the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase, Resulting in a Review of the Incremental Procurement Strategy. Two Options Were Considered. the First Was for a Single Programme that Effectively Would Have Combined all Three Funded Increments. This Would Have Necessitated the Project Returning to Pre-Initial Gate Status and Delayed the ISD by Up to Four Years. This Option Was Adopted as the Planning Assumption and Reflected in MPR 2005. the Second Option Was for the Delivery of “early Capability” that Would Provide for One Medium Scale Deployment by 2010. It Would Utilise the Savings Option Funding Profile and Exploit the Existing Contractor Bids for Increment A. This Option Was Explored and Found to be Viable.

In July 2005, Approval Was Given to the Further in-Depth Exploration of the Second Option and the Selection of BAE Systems Insyte as the Preferred Bidder for Falcon Increment A. a Programme Was Developed in Conjunction with the Preferred Bidder that Was Affordable Within the Available Funding. Falcon Increment C Achieved Main Gate Approval in July 2007 and Was Added as a Falcon Increment a Contract Amendment in September 2007.

## A.3. Progress

Following Main Gate Approval for Increment a in March 2006, the Demonstration and Manufacture Contract Was Awarded to BAE Systems Insyte. the Majority of the System Has Been Developed to a High Degree of Maturity and the System Validation and Verification Process Started, but There Have Been Delays to the Voice Telephony Sub-System and the Cryptographic Sub-System, which Have Had a Consequential Delay to the Whole Contract. the Equipment Acceptance Trial, a Key Milestone in the System’s Development, Was Completed Successfully and Reported as a Pass with Caveats in November 2009. Falcon Phase 2, which is in the Early Concept Stage and is Thus not Covered by the MPR, is Subject to a Financial Planning Round 2010 Option, this Option Being a Re-Profile and Would Result in a Delay to Phase 2 in Service Date by One Year.

Under the Director Information Systems and Services, Falcon is Being Considered as a Potential Candidate to Satisfy an Element of the Technical Architecture of Current Operations. This Initiative Has Resulted in a Joint MOD/BAE Systems Insyte Study as to the Feasibility of Falcon to Satisfy this Requirement.

As of April 2010, Falcon Was Approved as a Funded Urgent Operational Requirement at £55m in Preparation for Deployment to Afghanistan. an Information Note on the Programme Changes is in Course of Issue and will be Reflected in MPR 2011.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Falcon Increment a and Increment C will Deliver Secure One-to-One Voice and Wideband Data Networks to Deployed Forces, Including Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, Divisional and Brigade Headquarters and Unit Level Command Posts and Deployed Operating Bases. Without this Capability

Land and Air Forces will be Unable to Execute Effective Command and Control. in Addition, Falcon Increment a and Increment C will also Provide Wideband Data Coverage for Vital Intelligence Gathering Platforms Such as Airborne Stand Off Radar, Land Environment Air Picture Provision and

Watchkeeper. Without the Wideband Data Network Delivered under Falcon this Intelligence Information will not be Delivered to the Key Decision Makers in a Timely Fashion. Falcon Increment C will also Support the Increased Data Requirements of New Aircraft Such as Typhoon and will Allow Them to Operate from Deployed Operating Bases.
