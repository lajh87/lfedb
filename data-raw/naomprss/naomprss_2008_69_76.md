# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme will Update 30 Merlin Mk1 Aircraft to Overcome Existing and Forecast Obsolescence Within the Weapon System Avionics to Ensure Sustainment of the Required Capability until the Planned Out of Service Date (2029). the Approach Taken is One of System Level Technology Refresh of the Key Mission and Air Vehicle Avionic Systems. a Core Feature of the Programme is the Implementation of a Flexible Open Architecture that will Deliver Lower Cost of Ownership, Enable Cost-Effective Future Capability Insertion and Compliance with the Latest Safety Legislation. the Demonstration &
Manufacture Contract Has Been Placed with Lockheed Martin Aero Systems Integration Corporation, UK.

The Programme Includes the Necessary Updates to the Support and Training Environments. Towards the End of the Assessment Phase, the Programme Was Brought into the Future Rotorcraft Capability Programme. the Future Rotorcraft Capability Programme Provided Funding to Support a Transition Phase (Six Months) that Enabled Critical Path Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme Activities to Continue While Work Continued to Produce a Coherent Rotorcraft Programme Across the MoD. a Further Transition Phase (Six Months), which Was Subsequently Included Within the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme Main Gate Approval, Sustained the Programme Momentum While the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme Demonstration & Manufacture Programme Was Re-Crafted to Support the Wider Future Rotorcraft Capability Objectives and the Subsequent Approval Process.

The Main Gate Business Case Was Amended to Reflect the Impact of Future Rotorcraft Capability and Submitted to Investment Approvals Board in September 2005. HM Treasury and Ministerial Approval Was Granted in December 2005 with the Demonstration & Manufacture Contract Awarded Shortly Thereafter. the Formal Approval Followed in March 2006.

The Programme Commenced at the Start of 2006 and Remains on Track and Within Budget.

The Preliminary Design Review Was Completed Successfully on Schedule in January 2008 and the Programme is Currently Focussed on Working Towards the System Critical Design Review in September 2008. at Main Gate, the Investment Approvals Board Acknowledged that the Current Requirement Was for 38 Aircraft but Only Approved the Initial Procurement of 30. This Was to Allow Wider Future Rotorcraft Capability Studies on Higher Utilisation of Aircraft to Complete.

A Refresh of the Operational Analysis and the Completion of Future Rotorcraft Capability Studies Has Led to a Review Note that will be Submitted in the Second Quarter of 2008 for Approval. This will be for the Addition of Up to an Additional 8 Aircraft, at an Approximate Cost of £65m, Delivered as Part of the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme.

<tr>
<th>assessment Phase Following Approval of the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme Initial Gate Business Case, the Assessment Phase Contract Was Placed on 3rd June 2003. the Main Assessment Phase Activities Comprised:
<ul>
<li>analysis of the User Requirements and Development of a Consolidated Set of System Requirements in the Form of a Systems Requirements Document.</Li>
<li>production of System and Sub-System Design Requirements, and Seeking Initial Costed Proposals from Potential Suppliers.</Li>
<li>conducting Trade-Off Studies to Identify the Best Value Solution where Options Exist.</Li>
<li>developing a Coherent Plan for Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme, Aligned to Other Existing and Planned Merlin Programmes.</Li>
<li>undertaking Integrated Test, Evaluation and Acceptance Planning.</Li>
<li>identification of the Risks to the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme, and the Identification and Implementation of Mitigation Action to Reduce the Impact to an Acceptable Level.</Li>
<li>produce Documentation and Costed Proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase.</Li>
<li>undertaking Initial Integrated Logistic Support Activities to Define a Solution Compliant with the Evolving Support Solution Envelope.</Li>
</Ul>
Future Rotorcraft Capability Review During the Assessment Phase, MoD Embarked on a Review of all Future Rotorcraft Requirements under the Title of the Future Rotorcraft Capability Review. the Demonstration &amp; Manufacture Proposal that Had Been Provided by Industry and the Associated Business Case Were Produced Before the Impact of the Future Rotorcraft Capability Review Was Known. the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme Was Reviewed as Part of the Wider Future Rotorcraft Capability Programme. the Future Rotorcraft Capability Programme Determined that the Balance of Financial Investment over the First Four Years of the Equipment Programme Between Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme and Future Lynx Should be on a 50/50, 30/70, 30/70, 30/70 Basis Respectively. as a Result of this Financial Rebalancing the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme in-Service Date is 22 Months (50% Confidence) Later than Anticipated and the Estimated Cost of this Delay Led to an Overall Increase in the Equipment Program for Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme of £92m at Outturn. to Allow Industry to Continue Critical Path Activity and to Support the Reprogramming Activities Resulting from Future Rotorcraft Capability, the Future Rotorcraft Capability Programme Provided Transition Phase Funding (Six Months) to the Merlin Integrated Project Team for an Extension to the Assessment Phase Contract. a Further Transition Phase (Six Months) Was Required to Again Sustain Programme Momentum, Align it with Wider Future Rotorcraft Capability Requirements and Maintain Programme Viability During the Approvals Process.</Th>
