# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Team Complex Weapons initiative is designed to meet the UK's enduring requirement to have battle winning military capability through the use of Complex Weapons; to be assured that the weapons will perform as expected; and to retain the ability to develop leading edge Complex Weapons technologies. Within this context, the initiative aims to deliver:

1.  Improved, adaptable and flexible Complex Weapons (missiles and associated systems) that can be shaped to meet current and future military capability needs;

2.  Freedom of Action and Operational Advantage in our Complex Weapons through a sustained indigenous industrial construct.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

In April 2008 an Initial Gate submission was made to the Investment Approvals Board for the Complex Weapons Sector. This was approved in June 2008. The Business Case sought approval to enter a noncompetitive Assessment Phase with Team Complex Weapons. The Assessment Phase was designed to test the viability of UK Sovereign acquisition of Complex Weapons through a modular and funding pipeline approach that offered greater value for money. This was consistent with the Defence Industrial Strategy in maintaining operational sovereignty of UK Complex Weapons and sustaining UK industry's specialist capabilities.

Initial work considered a number of options, ranging from non-competitive procurement based around Team Complex Weapons, to full open competition. The options were assessed on their ability to meet military capability, operational sovereignty and value for money measured against the draft Concept of Analysis. The analysis strongly indicated that the continued use of competition would progressively erode the MOD's ability to secure affordable and effective military capability and restrict future choice and decision making.

## A.3. Project History

<thead>
<tr>
<th>The Team Complex Weapons proposition is founded on the Defence Industrial Strategy that set out the UK's intent to preserve operational sovereignty of its Complex Weapons. The first step in assessing the viability of a UK sovereign acquisition was a non-competitive Assessment Phase which was approved by the Investment Approvals Board (Initial Gate June 2008). This covered risk reduction work to develop solutions to meet the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (FASGW), Loitering Munition;
Storm Shadow Capability Enhancement Programme (SSCEP); Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS); and Selected Precision Effects at Range (SPEAR) programmes. Review Note 1 (March 2009) sought approval of a second tranche of money to continue the Assessment Phase and Review Note 2 (November 2009) sought approval for funds to conclude the Assessment Phase and to address the questions raised by the Investment Approvals Board (July/October 2009). The Assessment Phase concluded that the preferred option was a long term partnering model based on bilateral arrangements with the Team Complex Weapons Prime Contractors. With the Strategic Defence &amp; Security Review on the horizon Interim Main Gate 1 (March 2010) proposed entering into a shorter term Interim Portfolio Management Agreement (PMA-I) with MBDA UK. It also sought approval for expenditure to meet only immediate Complex Weapons requirements specifically:
Loitering Munition (Fire Shadow) (Demonstration &amp;
Manufacture);
SPEAR Capability 2 Block 1 (Demonstration &amp; Manufacture) (now Brimstone 2);
Future Local Area Air Defence System (Assessment Phase);
SPEAR Capability 2 Block 2 (now Spiral Development) (Assessment Phase); and SPEAR Capability 3 (Assessment Phase)

<th>Significant technical issues (e.g. propellant cracking and liner de-bonding) on the Vulcan rocket motor, manufactured by Roxel, were discovered in January 2012. In the following March a Red Team review commenced which increased confidence in the Roxel solution passing the testing environment. To monitor Roxel's progress a series of Risk Gate reviews were established, which was a prerequisite before seeking Investment Approvals Committee Approval for the programme. In order to mitigate the risk on operations in Afghanistan and other potential operations, resulting from the delay to the programme, the Defence Board approved a Decision Point 2 Option for a further buy of Dual Mode Seeker (non Insensitive Munition) Brimstone missiles. This additional buy was jointly funded by MOD and MBDA UK Ltd. MPR14 The Brimstone 2 programme made significant progress in year. Development trials to demonstrate flight software and seeker improvements successfully took place in the United States during SeptemberOctober 2013; the seeker and flight software development work is now complete. The trial was a key demonstration of capability and achieved direct hits on a variety of static and moving targets. Later in the year the first Tornado firing using the Roxel Insensitive Munition rocket motor was accomplished at Aberporth. Qualification of both energetic sub-systems (warhead and rocket motor) continue to progress without any failures and the rocket motor has now passed the previous failure points. This evidence, along with substantial supporting investigations and reports, led to the satisfactory closure of the Rocket Motor Recovery Programme that was enacted after the initial technical issues in January 2012.
Sea Ceptor (Demonstration and Manufacture)
Pre MPR14 The Main Gate Business Case for FLAADS Maritime Demonstration Phase (Interim Main Gate 2) was submitted to the IAC in April 2011 and was approved in December 2011. FLAADS Maritime was later officially named Sea Ceptor and is referred to as such throughout the PSS. Seeker Critical Design Review was held on 22 August 2012 with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory which demonstrated seeker readiness for air carriage trials. A Guided Firing Readiness Review (Significant Milestone) was conducted on 27 June 2012 and the deliverable was accepted by the Project Team by 30 September 2012. Critical Design Review commenced on 19 March 2013 with performance aspects completed in the second half of 2013. The MBDA schedule risk analysis conducted in February 2013 concluded that the 50% date for T23 Full Operating Capability In Service Date in 2016 was within 3 weeks of the approved baseline. The Project Team conducted risk mitigation and further analysis in order to close this variance. MBDA’s project schedule has been refined from 2,000 to 8,000 lines of detail since April 2011, as part of routine Demonstration Phase business, bringing significantly greater granularity to task elements. MPR14 The two planned Instrument Firings of the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile were completed successfully in April 2013. Approval of the Manufacture Phase and contract award with MBDA were achieved in September 2013. The Critical Design Review was completed in November 2013.
Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy)
Pre MPR14 Interim Main Gate 3 was the third of the submissions and concerned approval for the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy) Demonstration and Manufacture Phase. The Business Case was presented to Equipment Capability Secretariat on 9 January 2012 and was considered by the Investment Approvals Committee on 18 January. On 31 January Director General Finance approved the case, with a caveat that negotiations should be concluded with France before 31 March 2012. Bi-laterals continued, but by 28 March when Chief Secretary to the Treasury wrote to the MOD, discussions had not been concluded and as such Chief Secretary to the Treasury approved the case, subject to receiving French national approval. Approval from France was not immediately forthcoming and the Project sought reapproval.</th>

MPR14

The FASGW(H)/ANL (Anti Navire Léger (Light Anti Ship)) Concept and Assessment Phase concluded in December 2011 and following UK Approval to proceed to the Demonstration and Manufacture it was anticipated that a contract for FASGW(H) Demonstration and Manufacture would be let in Quarter 1 of 2012. However, owing to a change of Government in France, a Strategic Defence and Security Review

(termed “Livre Blanc”) was initiated resulting in France withdrawing its immediate support to

FASGW(H)/ANL pending the outcome of the “Livre Blanc” process. Consequently the FASGW(H)/ANL

Demonstration and Manufacture contract was not placed with the prime contractor MBDA. The “Livre Blanc” process concluded in April 2013 and France confirmed its commitment to the FASGW(H)/ANL project. Following a period of intense negotiations a contract was placed with MBDA for the Joint Programme on 26 March 2014.

Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Light)

MPR14

The FASGW(L) Demonstration and Manufacture Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approvals Committee on 15 October 2013. On 23 January 2014 the case was approved by Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Contractual negotiations are still ongoing with Thales.

Future Local Area Air Defence System (Land) Assessment Phase

MPR14

The FLAADS (Land) Initial Gate Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approvals Committee in October 2013 and was approved by the IAC on 21 January 2014. Subsequently an amendment was made to the Through Life Enabling Contract to include this tranche of work with MBDA.

Brimstone Support USE

MPR14

The Business Case for the continuation of the Brimstone In-Service Support phase was submitted on 17 September 2013 to Head of Defence Portfolio & Approvals Secretariat and approved on 3 October 2013. A five year contract was let in the same month. This included a short transition period with Full Service delivered from June 2014.

## A.4. In-Year Progress

Sea Ceptor

The two planned Guided Firings of the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile were completed successfully in

May / June 2014. The Intent To Fit on the First of Class vessel was confirmed by the Chair of the Sea Ceptor Project Board and the Type 23 Platform Duty Holder in June 14. The Design Freeze Review started in May 14 and was concluded in November 14.

FLAADS(Land) Assessment Phase

The assessment phase programme fed into the Ground Based Air Defence –
Falkland Island Phase 1 Main Gate Business Case, which was brought forward to December 2014. The remainder of the assessment phase will continue to July 2015 and inform the Land Ceptor GBAD Phase 1 Demonstration Phase which has now commenced.

Land Ceptor (GBAD Phase 1)

The Main Gate Business Case for FLAADS (Land) was brought forward to Dec 14. The Land Ceptor GBAD Phase 1 contract was placed on 05 January 15;
the project has been officially named LAND CEPTOR and is referred to as such throughout the PSS.

Land Ceptor forms part of Phase 1 of the wider Ground Based Air Defence Programme, led by the Joint

Sensor and Engagement Networks (JSENS) Delivery Team within the Intelligence Surveillance Target

Acquisition & Reconnaissance Operating Centre. JSENS are responsible for delivery of Battlefield

<tr>
<th>Mission Command, Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence,  Giraffe Agile Multi-Beam (GAMB) sensors and all associated non-equipment Defence Lines of Development.. The Short Range Air Defence Project Team, within the Weapons Operating Centre, is responsible for the development and delivery of the Launcher, direct integration with the Giraffe Agile Multi Beam (G-AMB) radar, the procurement of the Common Anti-air Modular Missile stockpile and the Land Ceptor-specific training, Infrastructure and Logistics requirements. Whilst the SHORAD Project Team retains responsibility for Land Ceptor and its integration with the GAMB radar, it is not responsible for the availability of G-AMB, nor leading on the non-equipment DLODs;
accountability remains within JSENS. Chief of Material (Joint Enablers) directed that, rather than having two Project Teams working to different goals, the single ownership of the capability within Defence Equipment and Support was preferred. As JSENS sits within Chief of Material (Joint Enablers)’s area, it was decided that JSENS would hold overall accountability for Phase 1 and Phase 2. The money for the Land Ceptor element of Phase 1 sits within Weapons, Evaluation &amp; Capability Assurance and therefore the Through Life Enabling Contract was seen as the most logical route for placing the work on contract with MBDA. Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Light) A contract with Thales for FASGW(L) was placed on 12 June 2014, followed by a contract with Agusta Westland for the integration of FASGW onto the Wildcat helicopter that was placed on 13 June 2014. The Preliminary Design Review for FASGW(L) was completed by Mar 2015. Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy) The Preliminary Design Review for FASGW(H) was held in June 2014 The first Product Gate 1 Ballasted Dummy Missile became available on 28 February 2015 Brimstone 2 Qualification of both energetic sub-systems (warhead and rocket motor) completed successfully in July 2014, two months ahead of schedule. Certificates of Design were issued for Brimstone 2 Missiles and Weapon Systems and signed by the Maritime &amp; Air Weapon Systems Project Team Leader in November 2014, two months ahead of schedule. Final ‘Operational Evaluation Trial’ commenced in February 2015 as planned. While the majority of trials objectives were met, several warheads did not detonate, requiring further work to ensure that the issue does not recur. Missile production was halted until identification and agreement of a resolution. SPEAR Cap 3 In December 2013 the Surface Attack Project Team presented a Review Note to the Investment Approvals Committee seeking approval for an increase in the cost and time of the project’s Assessment Phase. In March 2014 Director General Finance directed that further work be undertaken before approval could be given. This work was completed and in April 2014 the required clarifications were provided to Defence Portfolio and Approvals Secretariat. In June 2014 DG Finance approved part of the cost increase and requested a Project update at the turn of the year. In February 2015, after a comprehensive project review, the Investment Approvals Committee approved the full cost and time increases to the Assessment Phase and noted that the SPEAR Cap 3 Key User Requirements had been re-endorsed by Air Command. The Team Complex Weapons solution, MBDA’s SPEAR Cap 3 weapon, is the only weapon in the market that fulfils all the Key User Requirements (the US Small Diameter Bomb 2 (SDB2) weapon falls short on a number of the Key User Requirements) and there is clear Operational Analysis that supports the UK procurement of SPEAR Cap 3. The Investment Approvals Committee also approved the Spear Cap 3 Main Gate being deferred until 2018 with the development of the SPEAR Cap 3 weapon being continued through to 2018 with MBDA via an Assessment Phase extension, a business case for which is planned for submission to the Investment Approvals Committee in January 2016. Brimstone Unified Support Environment</th>

USE achieved Full Service Capability in Quarter 3 of 2014. Since then the Unified Support Environment contract was challenged by a significant increase in demand for Dual Mode Brimstone as a result of Operation SHADER (the British participation in the ongoing military intervention against Islamic State in

Iraq). A significant increase in availability of the existing stockpile was enabled by joint working between MBDA UK Ltd and Defence Equipment and Support as well as an uplift in stock. This has continued with Operation SHADER now expected to be an enduring commitment.

Advanced Short Range Air to Air Missile (ASRAAM) USE

A Business Case seeking approval for an In Service Support (ISS) solution using an Asset Availability Service was presented on 11 June 14. On 22 August 2014 Weapons, Evaluation & Capability Assurance approved the case and on 29 August the case was approved by Defence Portfolio and Approvals Secretariat. The Contract was let the following month and progress against the USE contract has been satisfactory. In the initial stages of the contract there were some minor issues with meeting the customer requirements for some assets at specific locations. However the shortcomings were within the permitted levels for that point in the contract. Note: The Contract Go Live date in Section C shows April 14. This is when MBDA began to provide the service. Between April and September the Company provided the service at their own risk in advance of the Contract being formally approved.

## A.5. Capability Risks

Interim Main Gate 1

Brimstone 2 - replaces the legacy Brimstone missile's energetics and airframe with a new Insensitive Munitions compliant warhead, rocket motor and an upgraded seeker and airframe. Brimstone 2 will replace the Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone capability currently in service with the Royal Air Force and will be integrated onto Tornado GR4 and is intended for integration on Typhoon.

Spear Capability 3 is a new 100kg class weapon. This capability is planned to be the primary air-toground armament for the Joint Combat Aircraft/F-35B Joint Strike Fighter from 2022, and optimised for internal carriage. Spear Capability 3 will provide the means to destroy/defeat a wide range of targets at range, including mobile and re-locatable targets, in all weathers day and night, in complex environments under tight Rules of Engagement.

Sea Ceptor

Sea Ceptor will provide increased capability over Sea Wolf that addresses the capability shortfall identified in the 2009 Capability Above Water capability audits. Sea Ceptor is the only candidate to fill the capability gap that is both affordable and will meet the Key User Requirements within the required timescales.

Future Local Area Air Defence System (Land) – is planned to replace the Rapier ground based air defence capability at its Out-Service-Date at the end of the decade.

Land Ceptor (GBAD Phase 1)

Land Ceptor will provide a replacement to the Rapier Ground Based Air Defence system towards the end of the decade and provide increased capability over the current system to match the increased in threat over the next 20 years.

With the addition of the Ground Based Air Defence Phase 2 capability, Land Ceptor will form part of a fully networked Ground Based Air Defence system.

Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy) and (Light)

FASGW will provide the Royal Navy with a missile enabling the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft, the Wildcat HMA Mk 2, to complete its full range of intended missions against target sets in the maritime and littoral environments. FASGW(H) will replace current capability provided by Lynx Mk 8 helicopters armed with Sea Skua missiles and FASGW(L) will address a deficit in the current anti-surface capability. \\\

ASRAAM Unified Support Environment

ASRAAM is currently supported by MBDA UK and other contractors under a limited scope of In Service Support activities and a Contractor Logistic Support contract which expires on 31 March 19. The inservice support solution meets the customer’s requirement and there is sufficient stockpile to maintain the capability out to the current contract end date. The capability risk is considered to be low, but there is a dependency on ongoing life-extension programmes delivering their expected outcomes.

<td colspan="5">The current support approach is through individual contracts for each weapon type, e.g. Storm Shadow, Advanced Short Range Air to Air Missile, etc. The intent is to secure a long term arrangement for each project under the Unified Support Environment with MBDA. This aims to secure financial benefits across the Programme in the in-service support of Weapons Systems. This will be achieved through common approaches, methods and tools, common requirements and the re-structuring of how support is delivered in industry. Brimstone and the Advanced Short Range Air to Air Missile (ASRAAM) are the first projects that have been contracted using the Unified Support Environment approach, with Storm Shadow to follow in Financial Year 15/16. Additional systems will be added at later dates.</td>

Original definition: The project will deliver 25 safe and useful munitions in March 2012 (50%). These will form a start-up capability for current operations. MPR 2012 definition: These definitions are not applicable yet given the incremental acquisition approach. In Service Date and Initial Operating Capability would likely occur in later increments and be subject to definition and approvals at an appropriate time. However, an initial batch of weapons systems was delivered, on time, in March 2012. These were demonstrated in June 2012 and while the success rate was lower than desired, performance of the hardware met the Fire Shadow key performance measures. Reason for change: The Senior Responsible Owner took a decision not to deploy the weapon for testing in Afghanistan as the capability was not sufficiently mature. It could therefore not meet its In-Service Date for use in Afghanistan so it has been re-defined.
