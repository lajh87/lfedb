# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1 The Requirement

A400M is planned to provide tactical and strategic mobility to all three Services. The required capabilities include: operations from airfields and semi-prepared rough landing areas in extreme climates and all weather conditions by day and night; carrying a variety of equipment including vehicles and troops over extended ranges; air dropping paratroops and equipment; and being unloaded with the minimum of ground handling equipment. The 1998 Strategic Defence Review confirmed a requirement for an airlift capability to move large single items such as attack helicopters and some Royal Engineers' equipment and concluded that this would be met, in the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century by Future Transport Aircraft. The A400M was selected to meet this requirement. It will replace the remaining Hercules C-130K fleet.

A400M is a collaborative programme involving seven European nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg, Spain, Turkey and United Kingdom). The design phase is nearing completion and manufacture activities have commenced. Delivery of the first UK aircraft to the Royal Air Force is expected in 2014.

## A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Government announced in December 1994 that it would replace its aging C-130K Hercules fleet, in part by procuring 25 C-130J's from Lockheed Martin and in addition, subject to certain conditions, by rejoining the next phase of the collaborative Future Large Aircraft programme (now known as A400M). The Future Large Aircraft 'Initial Gate' approval was achieved in July 1997 and in the same year the solution assumed for costing purposes was changed to an initial lease of four C-17 and subsequent procurement of 25 Future Large Aircraft. A Request For Proposals was issued to Airbus in September 1997 on behalf of the seven Future Large Aircraft nations (Belgium, France Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey and UK). Subsequently, in July 1998, four nations (Belgium, France, Spain and UK) issued a "competitive Request For Proposals" for a Future Transport Aircraft to Airbus Military (A400M), Boeing (C-17) and Lockheed Martin (C-130J).

Proposals were received on 29 January 1999 and parallel national and international assessments were undertaken. These covered Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisal, technical and commercial compliance, risk assessment, and an appraisal of the international dimensions. This work also led to parallel negotiations and clarification with the three bidders. At the direction of the Equipment Approvals Committee in December 1999, additional work was undertaken to inform the Main Gate submission. On 16 May 2000 the Government announced the decision to procure 25 A400M aircraft to meet the Future Transport Aircraft requirement.

## A.3 Project History

On 18 May 2000 the Investment Approvals Board approved the acquisition of 25 A400M aircraft with an

In Service Date of December 2009. Following the submission of a Review Note, on 8 May 2003 the Investment Approvals Board revised the In Service Date to December 2011 and defined it as being the delivery of the seventh UK A400M aircraft. This change was necessary due to delays in the German Parliamentary approvals process which had prevented signature of the multinational contract; approval was finally granted on 21 May and, on 27 May 2003, the A400M Development and Production Phase contract (including the UK order for 25 aircraft) was signed by OCCAR on behalf of the six partner nations.

On 27 May 2006 the Investment Approvals Board granted Initial Gate approval and the A400M In Service Support Assessment Phase commenced.

On 26 June 2008 the first complete A400M aircraft was rolled out from the Airbus Military Final Assembly Line facility in Seville.

On 25 September 2008 Airbus announced a delay to the first flight of the A400M prototype aircraft and, on 25 November, announced that it could further slip until the "second half" of 2009. On 27 November, Airbus Military briefed the A400M Programme Board (the senior multinational governance body) on its progress with reassessing the aircraft delivery schedule.

On 17 December 2008 the first flight of the A400M Flying Test Bed (an adapted C-130 aircraft) to undertake testing of the specially designed TP-400 turbo prop engine developed for A400M took place in Cambridge.

On 19 December 2008, Airbus Military sent a revised production schedule to OCCAR and, on 9 January 2009, Airbus Military proposed a
"new approach" to the A400M programme and sought negotiations with partner nations.

On 12 March 2009 a meeting of A400M partner nation defence ministers (at which the UK was represented by the Secretary of State) agreed to a "standstill agreement" with Airbus Military. This enabled discussions about options and possible outcomes for the A400M programme to take place whilst the rights of all parties under the original contract were protected. A period of intensive negotiation, combined with a thorough review of all aspects of the programme, then followed. Enter Text Here

On 11 December 2009 the first flight of MSN001 (the first A400M prototype aircraft) took place in Seville.

On 12 March 2010 the Investment Approvals Board reapproved the UK A400M programme with a revised In Service Date of 2015.

On 29 March 2010 in a Written Ministerial Statement the Secretary of State informed Parliament that agreement had been reached between A400M partner nations and Airbus Military on the future of the programme. Heads of Terms had been agreed that would form the basis for the negotiation of an amended contract (including the decision to amend the UK order from 25 to 22 aircraft). On 31 March 2010 the Heads of Terms were signed on behalf of partner nations by OCCAR with Airbus Military.

On 8 April 2010 the first flight of MSN002 (the second prototype aircraft) took place in Seville, followed on 9 July 2010 by the first flight of MSN003 (the third prototype), also in Seville.

On 19 October 2010 the Strategic Defence and Security Review announcement stated that A400M would be a key element of the RAF future air transport fleet. It also announced the bringing forward of the Hercules C-130J Out of Service Date from 2030 to 2022.

On 5 November 2010 the substantive contract amendment (which included revised aircraft production and delivery schedules) was agreed by partner nations' representatives and sent for national staffing and approval prior to signature. The UK had already achieved reapproval in March.

## A.4 In-year Progress

Following the signature of the amended Design and Production Phase contract on 7 April 2011, the revised aircraft production and delivery schedules remain on track. Programme and Project Review Meetings (held on a quarterly basis) at which Airbus Military present details of the current programme status and forthcoming activities to partner nations and OCCAR, indicate that steady progress continues to be made.

Investigation work into the causes of engine problems encountered in June 2011 during flight trials have concluded and solutions have been developed. Although this caused some disruption to the flight trials programme, this is not expected to have a significant impact on the aircraft production schedule.

Although the A400M is a military transport aircraft, its design will be predominantly civil certified, with additional military certification as necessary. With the exception of long distance endurance flying, all flight trials associated with the initial Type Certificate clearance were completed by the end of March 2012. The evidence produced by these trials has been evaluated by the European Aviation Safety Agency and a Restricted Type Certificate was granted in late April 2012.

The first flight of MSN006 (the fifth and final prototype aircraft) took place on 20 December 2011. Together the trials fleet had amassed 2944 flying hours and 1002 test flights by 25 March 2012.

## A.5 Capability Risks

Not proceeding with this capability would significantly reduce the UK's tactical air transport capability due to having to rely solely on C-130J aircraft to provide support to operations after the C-130K Out of Service Date in 2013. Furthermore, not proceeding would mean that the UK will not have any tactical air transport capability after 2022, (the revised Out of Service Date for the C-130J declared in the Strategic Defence and Security Review) and less than the planned for Strategic lift capability, as it would be dependant solely on the current fleet of seven (which will increase to eight when an additional aircraft is delivered in May 2012) C-17 aircraft.

The achievement of Restricted Type Certificate has significantly derisked the programme, and is a major step towards achieving a deliverable aircraft. Future capability risks include the ongoing development of military functionality, the delivery of an appropriate support solution and the provision of trained crews to match aircraft deliveries. These risks are well understood and work is ongoing to undertake effective mitigation activity.
