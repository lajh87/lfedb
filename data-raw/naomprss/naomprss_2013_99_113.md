# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Service will Provide the Air-to-Air Refuelling and the Passenger Air Transport Capability Currently Provided by the Royal Air Force’s Fleet of VC10 and TriStar Aircraft. Air-to-Air Refuelling is a Key Military Capability that Significantly Increases the Operational Range and Endurance of Front Line Aircraft Across a Range of Defence Roles and Military Tasks.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Was Nominated as a Potential Private Finance Initiative Project in 1997. an Assessment Phase, Designed to Confirm Whether a Private Finance Initiative Would Offer Best Value for Money, Was Launched Following Initial Gate Approval in December 2000.

The Assessment Phase Confirmed Industry’s Ability to Meet the Service Requirement, Programme Timescales and Costs and Determined that the Inclusion of Passenger Air Transport Capability in the Contract Would Represent Value for Money. It also Clarified the Manning and Personnel Implications

## A.3. Project History

The Main Gate Business Case Was Submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in January 2007 and Was Approved in May 2007. in March 2008 a 27 Year Private Finance Initiative Contract Was Signed. the Final Approval Envelope for Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Was Set by the Investment Approvals Board in June 2008.

The Investment Approvals Board Approved Contract not to Exceed Cost Remains at £10.5 Bn. in Addition There will be Front Line Command Manpower and Support Costs Leading to a Total Cost of £12.3 Bn.

The Successful Maiden Flight of the First Green Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft A330-200 Aircraft Took Place on the 4th June 2009; the Aircraft Was Subsequently Delivered for Conversion to the Airbus Military Purpose-Built Hangar Facility Getafé in Spain on the 10th July 2009. It Was Joined by the Second Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Aircraft on the 7th September 2009; both Aircraft Have Now Been Converted for their Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Role, which Includes Fitting of Military Avionics as Well as the Specialist Refuelling Equipment. Following this Work both Aircraft Moved into the Certification and Qualification Programme.

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is not Simply About the Procurement of Aircraft, but Covers all Aspects of an Integrated Worldwide Aircraft Service, Ranging from the Provision of the Infrastructure, Including a Hangar Complex (which Allows for the Maintenance of Two Aircraft Simultaneously and Houses the Two Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Squadrons, the Maintenance Crew; Operations Centre and Associated Office Accommodation), a Full Flight Crew and Engineer Training Service, Despatch and Ground Support. the New Facility, Known as the AirTanker Hub, Was Completed Ahead of Schedule and Was Officially Opened on 31 March 2011, for the Provision of the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Service at Royal Air Force Brize Norton.

The Construction of the Training Facility Building Was Completed Ahead of Schedule.

TEMPEST and Defensive Aids Sub System Testing Began at Boscombe Down on 18 April 2011 and Ground Testing for Air to Air Refuelling with Receivers Began in May 2011.

European Aviation Safety Agency Issued the Supplemental Type Certificate 1 and 2 to Airbus Military on 20 April 2011 and 29 July 2011 Respectively. MOD and Air Tanker Signed a Contract on 11 July 2011 to Allow C130 Hercules Aircraft to Use the Hangar for Line Maintenance.

Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox Named the Future Strategic Transport Aircraft ‘voyager’ at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Royal Air Force Fairford on 15 July 2011.

Cobham Achieved the UK Civil Aviation Authority Approval for the Extension to their European

Aviation Safety Agency Part-145 Accreditation, to Include Base and Line Maintenance for the Airbus A330-243 Series Aircraft on 23 August 2011, Signifying the Beginning of the Conversion Programme at Cobham.

On the 10 October 2011 the Civil Aviation Authority Issued the Part 145 & M Certificate to Air

Tanker Services. This Completed the Set of Air Tanker Services Deliverables for Introduction to Service. Because of Problems in the Trials Programme and Delay in Delivery of Documentation from Air Tanker, the Introduction to Service Date Slipped to February 2012.

The First Voyager Aircraft Arrived at Royal Air Force Brize Norton on 21 December 2011. on Arrival, Air Tanker Registered the Aircraft and Obtained the Civil Aviation Authority Certificate of Airworthiness. the Originally Planned Flight Trials to Clear Wing Pod Air to Air Refuelling for Tornado and Typhoon Finished in December 2011. These Trials Identified Problems Associated with Fuel Leakage at Various Parts of the Air to Air Refuelling Clearance Flight Envelope. Rectification Plans for These Issues Were Finally Agreed with Air Tanker and the Independent Technical Adviser on 31 January 2012. the Simulator Test Readiness Review Completed Successfully on 10 January

2012.the Type Certification Exposition Version 5 for Air Transport &
Aeromed 3 Was Issued on 2

February 2012.capability Acceptance at Introduction to Service Acknowledged that Only the Air Transport and Aeromed 3 Elements of the Capability Had Been Achieved on 2 February 2012, but not Achievement of an Acceptable Air to Air Refuelling capability.The Director Air Support Signed the Voyager Release to Service Recommendation for Air Transport and Aeromed 3 Only, on 21

<th>future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Project Has Previously Been Reported in the Major Projects Report on a Forecasted Whole Life Cost Basis, Including all Costs (Up to 2035) for PFI Contract and Other Costs Incurred by MOD in Use of the PFI Service. Public Accounts Committee on 4th February 2013 Agreed that Fuel Costs Would be Removed from Future Reports. MOD and NAO Have Agreed for Major Projects Report 2013 that Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Project Should be Reported on a Basis Similar to that of Other Projects. This Results in a Reduction in the Approval Value from £12,307 Million, Reported in 2012, to £11,779 Million Reported this Year. the Fuel Elements Have also Been Removed from the Forecast Cost and Cost Variations. FSTA Continues to Build Capability. the 1st Voyager Aircraft is in Trials Programme with Airbus Military. the 2nd Aircraft (MOD’s 1st Delivered) Was Granted a Release to Service for Air Transport on 4 April 12, Was Placed on Military Aircraft Register on 5 Apr 12 and Commenced Operational Flying. Following Experience on the 3rd and 4th Aircraft Conversions, Industry Decided in Jun 12 to Move Remaining 10 Conversions to Airbus Military Facility in Getafe Near Madrid. the 3rd Aircraft Was Delivered End of Dec 12, Transferred to the Military Register and Commenced Air Transport Tasking. a Standard (Un-Converted) Airbus A330 Has Been Used Since 5 Jan 13 by AirTanker Services. This
“green” Aircraft Has Alleviated Pressure on AAR Crew Training During 2013 Through Being Used for Air Transport Operations Instead of Other Voyager Aircraft. It will be Fed Back into the Conversion Programme in Jan 15. MOD Placed on Contract the Enhanced FSTA Aircraft Platform Protection System (EDAS). Embodiment is Underway, as Planned in the Programme and is also Reflected in Wider Defence Capability Planning. Voyager Infrastructure at RAF Brize Norton Completed, also the Training Service Stood Up with the Full Flight Simulator Operational and Used to Train Crews. the 4th Voyager Aircraft Was Delivered on Time at the End of April 2013. the Remaining Deliveries Remain on Schedule and the May 14 ISD Remains Unchanged.</Th>

The Agreed Rectification Programme Was Completed with the Initial AAR System Problems Resolved Through Modifications. However During Flight Trials of the Modified Equipment, Another Problem Emerged of ‘basket Tipping’ with Resulting Risk of Either Receiver Aircraft Damage or Pilot Disorientation. an Interim Solution to Address this Issue Has Been Agreed Utilising a Different Drogue. Airborne Trials Were Held in Late 2012 and an Operational Clearance Release to Service (RTS) Within a Limited Envelope (which is Planned to Widen During 2013) for Voyager to Refuel Tornado Was Granted 16 May 2013 with Operational AAR Sortie Flying from 20 May 2013. Work Continues During 2013 Toward Achievement of RTS for Voyager to Refuel Typhoon and C130.

## A.5. Capability Risks

The First VC10 Aircraft Entered Service in the 1960s and These Were Converted to Air-to-Air Refuelling Tankers at Various Dates Between 1980 and 1996. the Aircraft Has Ageing and Outdated Technology, and the Risks to Maintaining Reliability and Value for Money Have Grown and Ultimately it will not be Possible to Sustain Capability. These VC10 Aircraft are Planned to Go Out of Service in 2013. the TriStar Aircraft First Entered Airline Service in the Early 1970s and Converted to their Current Tanker and Tanker/Freight Roles Between 1983 and 1987. These Aircraft are Planned to Go Out of Service in 2014.

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Programme will Provide the Royal Air Force with a Reliable, Safe and Efficient Air Transport and Air to Air Refuelling Service until Its Out of Service Date in 2035.

The Primary Role for the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft will be Air-to-Air Refuelling, and the Objective of These Operations is to Enhance Combat Effectiveness by Extending the Range, Payload or Endurance, of Front Line Fast Jet Aircraft and Large Aircraft Types where and when it is Needed. Timely Delivery of FSTA Aircraft and Operational Clearances is Essential to Maintain the UK's Strategic Deployment and Tactical Strike Capabilities.
