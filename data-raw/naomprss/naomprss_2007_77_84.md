# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Following UK Participation in the Concept Demonstration Phase of the Programme, the US Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Was Selected to Meet the JCA Requirement. the Strategic Defence Review Confirmed this Requirement to Provide the Joint Force 2000 (Joint Command for Harrier Forces) with a Multi-Role Fighter/Attack Aircraft to Replace the Royal Navy Sea Harrier and the Royal Air Force Harrier GR7/9. a Tailored Main Gate Demonstration Approval Was Obtained in January 2001 for Participation in the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase to the Value of £1.3bn, along with £600m for Related Non-SDD Work, Leading to Signature that Month by UK and US Governments of the SDD Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). the Selection of Lockheed Martin as the JSF Air System Prime Contractor Included a Teaming Agreement with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to Collectively Form Team JSF. Two Separate and Competitive Propulsion Contracts Were Awarded to Pratt and Witney for the F135 Engine and GE/Rolls Royce Fighter Engine Team for the F136 Engine. Whilst Other Partners Joined the Programme at Level 2 and 3 Entry Arrangements, Only US and UK Requirements Drive the SDD Baseline Solution.

In September 2002 the UK Selected the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) JSF Variant to Meet Our Requirement. a Review of the JSF Programme and the Viability of the STOVL Design Was Completed in January 2005 and Concluded that a Successful Programme of Weight Reduction Initiatives and Other Performance Enhancements Had Restored Confidence that the STOVL Design Should Remain the UK’s Planning Assumption. a Further Review by the Investment Approvals Board (IAB) in July 2006 Confirmed this Decision.

On 12 December 2006 Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support Signed the Production Sustainment and Follow-on Development MoU, Reporting of this Phase will Commence in MPR09 when the UK Plan to Purchase the First Aircraft, Allowing the UK to Continue to Influence all Aspects of the JSF Programme as it Moves into a New Phase.

The Flight Test Programme Commenced on 15 December 2006 with the Successful First Flight of the First Conventional Take-Off and Land (CTOL) Aircraft. the First STOVL Aircraft is Currently Planned to Fly in Summer 2008. Continued Participation in the JSF Programme will Deliver a Block 3 Aircraft with Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground Capabilities to the UK.

Two Key User Requirements (KUR) Remain at Risk:

KUR04 - Mission Performance: In July 2006 the IAB Directed that Ship-Borne Rolling and Vertical Landing (SRVL) Should be Included in Future Development of the JCA Design to Mitigate the Risk to the Vertical Land Bring Back Capability.

KUR06 – Logistic Footprint: Performance Remains Marginally Better than Requirement, Although Due to Very Narrow Margin this KUR Remains at Risk. Work is Ongoing with Lockheed Martin to Drive Down Logistic Footprint to Ensure it Remains Within Specification as the Air System Matures Throughout the SDD Phase.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Approval Was Obtained in November 1996 to Enter the Concept Demonstration Phase (CDP) on the JSF Programme under an MOU Signed in December 1995. the Phase Began in November 1996 with Two Competing US Prime Contractors (Boeing and Lockheed Martin) Designing Weapons Systems and Flying Demonstration Aircraft on which the Selection of the Preferred Bidder Was Based. the Phase Completed in October 2001 with the Announcement of Lockheed Martin as the Successful Bidder. Studies into Alternative Options to JSF to Meet the Requirement Were also Conducted but Were Rejected on Cost Effective Grounds. the Options Were US F/A18E, French Rafale M, a “navalised” Eurofighter and an Advanced Harrier.

[^1]: The JCA Main Gate Was Tailored for Development Only to Match the US Procurement Cycle. Unit Production Cost Approval will be Sought as Part of MG UK Production Approval.

[^2]: The in Service Date (ISD) Approval will be Sought as Part of the Incremental Production Approval Strategy.

[^3]: Three Point Estimates for the Production Phase Have yet to be Determined, as Costs are Dependant on the Final Aircraft Numbers.

† for MG Development Approval, ISD Was Noted, not Approved.
