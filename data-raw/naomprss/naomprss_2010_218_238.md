Sensors and Weapons and a Flexible and Upgradeable Mission System. Support, Infrastructure and a Ground Based Training Environment will also be Provided. Advanced Jet Trainer is Contracted for in Such a Way to Ensure that it can be Subsumed Within the Main UK Military Flying Training System Contract at a Later Date.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Four Possible Procurement Options Were Identified at Initial Gate. the Do-Nothing Option Was Discounted. the Do Minimum Option Would not Deliver the Required Quality and Quantity of Students in the Correct Timescales. the Remaining Options, Public Private Partnership/Private Finance Initiative and Smart Conventional, Were Tested in a Convergence Phase which Concluded that the Adoption of a

Public Private Partnership Contractual Partnering Model Would Best Harness the Collective Skills of MOD and Industry by Utilising a Mix of Private Finance Initiative and Conventional Procurement to Deliver a Coherent and Flexible System of Systems.

This Option Envisaged the Appointment of a Training System Partner to Work with the MOD over the Life of the Project to Deliver Incrementally the Total Aircrew Training Requirement. the Strategy Was Approved by Investment Approvals Board in February 2005. an Invitation to Negotiate Was Issued to Three Consortia in March 2005; the Bids Were Received in August 2005. the Main Gate Business Case (Stage 1) Was Approved by Investment Approvals Board and Ascent Was Announced as Preferred Bidder in November 2006. the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Main Gate (Stage 2) Submission in the Form of an Information Note Was Submitted in December 2007. This Was Approved by Minister (Defence Equipment and Support) and Treasury in February 2008. the Training System Partner Contract Was Signed in May 2008.

Additional Assessment Work will be Required Post-Main Gate for the Different Training Platforms that will be Acquired Incrementally. These Increments will be Subject to Further Approvals.

Contract Award for the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Was May 2008. the Head Lease for the Military Flying Training System Headquarters Building Was Signed 17^th^ April 2008.

Advanced Jet Trainer

At Initial Gate (December 2002) Advanced Jet Trainer Was a Component of United Kingdom Military

Flying Training System. Within the £39m Approved for United Kingdom Military Flying Training

System Assessment, £2m Related to Advanced Jet Trainer and a PFI Approach Was Assumed. in July 2003 a Ministerial Direction Was Given to Conventionally Procure Hawk 128 from BAE Systems.

In 2003 a £31m Risk Reduction Contract Was Placed with BAE Systems to Cover Risk Reduction Activities to October 2003. BAE Systems Continued to Work at Risk on Assessment Phase Activities Up to November 2004 when Approval Was Given for a Combined Assessment & Development Phase Based on an Incremental Approach at a not to Exceed Price of £196m and a not to Exceed Completion Date of August 2008; the Assessment Phase Element of this Approval Was Around £75m. a Design and Development Contract Was Let to BAE Systems in December 2004.

Main Gate Approval Was Achieved in August 2006 for a not to Exceed Figure of £497m at 80% Confidence, Compared to Initial Gate Approval of £611m at 90%. This Approval Set the Aircraft Build Standard, Definition of in-Service Date, Key Performance Measures and Aircraft Numbers.

In May 2008 a Contract Was Placed with BAE Systems to Extend the Initial Demonstration and Manufacturing Phases to Deliver the Incremental Capability (Operational Capability 2). the Upgrade is Primarily a Software Upgrade that Adds Synthetic Simulation for Radar, Advanced Air-to-Air and Air-Toground Missiles and Surface to Air Missile Threats.

Initial Support Contracts Were Placed in Jul 2008, August and December 2009 with BAE Systems to Provide Support Capability for the Aircraft at RAF Valley until December 2010. the in-Service Support Contract for the Period to March 2014 Was Placed on the 31 March 2010.

## A.3. Progress

United Kingdom Military Flying Training System

Following Award of the Training System Partner Contract the Next Phase of the Programme Was the Provision of a Training Capability for the Royal Navy Observers – Rear Crew Training Stage 1. a Review Note Was Submiited in November 2007 Seeking Approval to Issue the Invitation to Negotiate, this Was Approved in December 2007. in May 2009 the Main Gate Business Case Was Submitted and Approved Subject to Caveats in Relaton to in Year Affordability and Safety and Environmental Assurances. an Information Note Was Submitted in July 2009 Confirming Resolution of the Caveats and the Contract Was Subsequently Awarded in July 2009.

Advanced Jet Trainer

Operational Capability 0 Was Completed by BAE Systems in August 2008 and Release to Service Was Achieved in April 2009. Iinitial Spares Have Been Delivered to RAF Valley, Maintainers and Conversion Training for Pilots Completed and BAE Systems Delivered the First Production Aircraft in February 2009. the Operational Capability 2 Development Programme is Progressing to Plan. Minister Approved the in Service Support Review Note in January 2010 with HM Treasury and Commitment Approval Received in March 2010

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Current Training System is Unable to Train Aircrew to the Standard Required, or to Provide Sufficient Aircrew to Meet Manning Requirements. Unless the Training System is Equipped to Provide the Skills Needed, Operational Effectiveness will be Seriously Degraded. with Legacy Training Aircraft Fast Approaching their Out of Service Date There is a Belief that the Current System will not be Able to Sustain the Front Line in the Long Term. Financial Provision Made in 2010 to Maintain Coherency Has Demonstrated that Support Costs to Extend Current Platforms are more Expensive.

The Advanced Jet Trainer (Increment a) Delivers the Phase 4 Fast Jet Training Element into the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Project. There is a Dependency on the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Project for the Provision of Ground Based Training Environment to Achieve Advanced Jet Trainer Initial Operating Capability.

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Watchkeeper will Provide the Operational Commander with a 24 Hour, all Weather, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Capability Supplying Accurate, Timely and High Quality Imagery to Support Decision Making. the System will Consist of Unmanned Air Vehicles, Sensors, Data Links and Ground Control Stations. Watchkeeper is Planned to be Delivered Through an Incremental Programme to Allow the System to Benefit from both Existing and Developing Sensors and Air Vehicle Technology.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Watchkeeper is a Consolidation of the Sender and Spectator Projects. Initial Gate Approval Was Received for Sender in November 1999 and Approval for a Joint Assessment Phase for both Projects Was Given in July 2000.

The Acquisition Strategy Has Been Based on Selecting Unmanned Air Vehicle Systems to Suit a Defined Capability Requirement Rather than an Air Vehicle-Centred Approach. Through Evaluation and System Concept Demonstration, the Assessment Phase Has Driven Down Technical and Schedule Risks and Derived the Whole Life Costs Associated with the Proposed Options. User and System Requirements Were Identified and Revalidated. Trade-Off Activity Was Undertaken, Taking Full Account of the Impact Across all Lines of Development and Supported by Balance of Investment Studies.

Alternative Acquisition Options Have Been Considered. PPP/PFI Was not Deemed Appropriate for the Provision of a Tactical Capability Deployed in Theatre, Due to the Potential Risks to Contractor Personnel and the Required Levels of Availability as Well as Legal Implications. Collaboration Was Explored During the Early Stages of the Assessment Phase, but it Was not Possible to Align Requirements. There is Continuing Dialogue with and Between Allied Nations on Matters of Requirement Definition, Technology, Operational Experience and Acquisition. the Need for Significant System Integration with the Emerging Network Enabled Capability Requirements Led the then Defence Procurement Agency and the Potential Contractors to Adopt an Incremental Approach to Delivery. This Approach also Supports the Force Readiness Cycle which Provides for a Phased Uplift of Capability at Discrete Intervals. Opportunities to Enhance Watchkeeper Beyond the Full Operating Capability Have Been Considered During the Assessment Phase and will Inform Future Investment Decisions.

Following a Competitive Process, Thales (UK) Was Announced as Preferred Bidder in July 2004. the Programme Completed the Assessment Phase of the Acquisition Cycle in July 2005, when Main Gate Approval Was Given to Proceed to the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase.

## A.3. Progress

In July 2005, Following an International Competition, Thales (UK) Was Awarded the Watchkeeper Demonstration and Manufacture Phase Contract as Prime Contractor. Major Project Milestones Completed to Date Include the System Design Review in December 2005, the Preliminary Design Review in July 2006 and the Critical Design Review of the Air Vehicle in December 2006. the System Critical Design Review Was Conducted in May 2007 and Finalised in September 2007 with the Completion of the De-Icing Critical Design Review.

Watchkeeper’s Maiden Flight Took Place on 16 April 2008 in Israel and Was Followed by the Successful Achievement of the Automatic Take Off &
Landing System Demonstration in July 2008. Stage 2 Flight
