FUTURE LYNX

Integrated Project Team Responsible:

LYNX

Single Point of Accountability for project capability:

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

The Future Lynx capability was developed to meet the requirement for a dedicated small helicopter for use in both the land and maritime environments. Future Lynx is a single-source, combined helicopter procurement programme with Westland Helicopters Ltd which follows More Effective Contracting principles. Project approval is for 80 aircraft, with funding for 70 held by the Integrated Project Team, and funding for a further 10 held by the Helicopter Strategy Team. The Demonstration &
Manufacture contract was let in June 2006 to deliver 70 aircraft: 40

Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters for the Army and 30 Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft for the Navy to replace the current Lynx fleet which is reaching its life end. The contract also includes costed options for five more platforms of each type. Preliminary and Interim Critical Design Reviews have been successfully achieved in January and October 2007 respectively, and machining of airframe parts commenced in October 2007. Significant future milestones are: Air Vehicle Critical Design Review in April 2008, Interim Phase Review in November 2008 and First Flight in November 2009. Through-life training & support solutions are to be developed as part of the project. An Information Note was approved in July 2007 to submit the Support Solution Review Note in September 2009. Approval was given for the Training Service Initial Gate Business Case in August 2007 which is based on the 4-stage PFI Treasury Approval process.

The project has two ISDs as it is delivering two different capabilities. The first ISD is for the

Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter and is reported in Section 3. The current forecast ISD for Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft is January 2015. This is defined as one deployable aircraft with logistic support, trained aircrew and groundcrew in place.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Initial Gate approval was given in December 2001 for the Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter and in September 2002 for the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft. Following review under the Future Rotorcraft Programme the Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter requirement matured into the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter requirement.

Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter:

The Assessment Phase benchmarked Westland Helicopter Ltd’s Future Lynx proposal against alternative off-the-shelf solutions from other potential suppliers, and required the company to demonstrate the necessary level of performance to successfully deliver the Demonstration & Manufacture phase.

Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft:

A single tender contract was placed with Westland Helicopter Ltd to develop and de-risk their Future Lynx proposal to meet the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft requirement in conjunction with the approved Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter programme.

Procurement Strategy:

Two procurement strategies were considered. The first was to run a competition and second, to pursue the Westland Helicopter Future Lynx proposal on a single tender basis - with an option to switch from single tender to competition should the Assessment Phase indicate that the Future Lynx solution was unlikely to be cost effective. The second strategy was the selected one.

The result of the Assessment Phase considered the Future Lynx to be the most likely of the options to deliver the required capability by the ISD. This gave the benefit of maintaining industrial capability in the UK. Hence a single tender approach was judged most likely to offer both the best technical solution and best value for money overall.

The Assessment Phase successfully de-risked a number of key requirements, including secure communications, mission systems and engine certification. Furthermore, Westland Helicopter Ltd’s Super Lynx 300 export programme demonstrated their capability to insert new T-800 engines, glass cockpit and avionics into the Lynx aircraft.

## 5b. Cost of the Assessment Phase

| £m (outturn prices)       | Assessment Phase cost | Proportion of total estimated procurement expenditure |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Actual Cost                   | 57                        | 2.9%                                                      |
| Approved Cost at Initial Gate | 59                        | 2.9%                                                      |
