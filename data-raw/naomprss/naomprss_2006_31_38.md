# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Bowman will Provide a Secure Tactical Voice and Data Communications System for all Three Services in Support of Land, Littoral and Air Manoeuvre Operations. It will Replace the Increasingly Obsolete Clansman Combat Radio System and the Headquarters Infrastructure Element of the Ptarmigan Trunk System.

In September 2001, Following International Competition, General Dynamics UK Ltd Was Awarded the Bowman Supply and Support Contract as Prime Contractor, and Conducted Its Own Competition Amongst Sub-Contractors. at this Time it Was Planned to Field Bowman in the Following Capability Increments: Initial Operating Capability in November 2003 and in Service Date (ISD) Capability in March 2004, to be Followed by a Land Operational Readiness Date (ORD).

Following the Decision in December 2002 to Commit the Army to Convert to Bowman, Progress Against the Programme Has Been Assessed at Successive Acceptance and Release Points Against all Eight Lines of Development (Including Equipment and Technology Led by the Defence Procurement Agency). These Assessments Aim to Ensure that all Relevant Elements Contributing to the Delivery of Capability and Sustainability in Service are Formally Reviewed. on the Basis of Brigade Scale Operational Field Trials, Bowman Achieved Its ISD on 26 March 2004. Subsequent Uplifts in Military Capability Have Been Extensively Tested in a Programme of Demanding and Complex Laboratory and Technical Field Trials. in December 2004, the Completion of a Further Brigade Scale Operational Field Trial Permitted the First Bowman Converted Brigade to Deploy to Iraq on Operation TELIC with a Core Bowman Capability Alongside Its Residual Clansman Capability. Continued Operational Experience in Iraq Indicates that Bowman is Delivering a Battle Winning Capability.

Recognition of the Inextricable Linkage Between Bowman and CIP Provided the Opportunity to Undertake a Programmatic, Technical and Risk Review from December 2004 to Ensure Better that the Combined Programmes Would Deliver a Coherent, Stable and Minimum Capability Consistent with the MOD’s Vision of Achieving Network Enabled Capability. the Outcome of this Review Was Submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in a Review Note in December 2005 and will Form the Basis for Completing the Demonstration and Manufacture (D&M) Phase of the Bowman (and CIP) Contract. Littoral Manoeuvre (Amphibious) ORD Was Declared in December 2005 and Planning Continues to Declare Land and Air Manoeuvre Operational Readiness Before the End of the D&M Phase.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Bowman Was First Approved in 1988, when it Was Expected to Have the Equivalent of Main Gate in 1993 and ISD in 1995. After Feasibility Stage 1 in 1993, Contracts Were Placed with Two Competing Consortia for Feasibility Stage 2 (FS2) and Project Definition Stage 1.

FS2 Indicated that the Risk of Procuring and Integrating the Local Area Sub-System (LAS) Would be Best Managed by Placing the Responsibility with the Bowman Contractor. This Change in Procurement Strategy Was Approved in 1997, along with Bowman Core Risk Reduction Work.

In November 1996, the Previous Two Consortia Formed a Joint Venture Company, Archer

Communications Systems Ltd (ACSL) to Submit a Joint Bid for Bowman. the Department Approved a Single Source Strategy for Bowman Following a Review of Procurement Options. a Risk Reduction Contract Was Placed with ACSL in August 1997. ACSL Received a Further Package of Work in October 1998 Worth £182m Prior to Production Commitment at Main Gate, then Planned for November 2000.

The Department Rejected ACSL’s Bid in July 2000, Removed their Preferred Supplier Status and Relaunched the Competition, as it Was not Convinced ACSL Could Meet an Early ISD. TRW Ltd, Computing Devices Canada Ltd (CDC), Now General Dynamics UK Ltd, and Thales Defence Ltd Competed for the Contract, which Was Won by CDC in July 2001. Equipment Approvals Committee Gave Main Gate Approval in August 2001 and the Bowman Supply and Support Contract Was Signed on 13 September 2001.
