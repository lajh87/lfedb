• Post Main Investment Decision - Support Vehicle

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Support Vehicle programme will procure the future tri-service cargo and recovery vehicles that will increase the military material lift/distribution and recovery capabilities. The programme will procure a fleet of vehicles consisting of 42 variants but effectively based around the Light, Medium and Heavy Cargo Vehicles (6, 9 and 15 tonnes respectively), the 7,000 litre Unit Support Tanker, the Recovery Vehicle and the Recovery Trailer. These vehicles will replace the in-service 4, 8 and 14 tonnes cargo vehicles and the three in-service recovery vehicle types.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

There was no Assessment Phase. The Support Vehicles programme had its origins as the Future Cargo Vehicle and the Future Wheeled Recovery Vehicle projects. These were launched as potential Private Finance Initiative programmes with advertisements in August 1998 and September 1999 respectively. The Future Cargo Vehicles project progressed through Pre-Qualification and Outline Proposal stages with five bidders short-listed. An Initial Gate Business Case was drafted in December 1999, but was not submitted for approval because it did not demonstrate value for money.

Further work was requested to identify areas for further innovation, and also to develop a ‘smart’ Public Sector Comparator. Work continued to produce a more robust case but it became clear that confidence in Private Finance Initiative procurement was unlikely to improve. The decision was taken in March 2001 to replace the Private Finance Initiative procurement strategy with a conventional strategy and hold a fresh competition. Furthermore the Future Cargo Vehicles and Future Wheeled Recovery Vehicle programmes were merged into a single procurement and proceeded directly to the main investment decision which was secured in November 2001. The project bypassed the Assessment Phase because it was concluded that the technologies were mature and as the Department had, during the Private Finance Initiative phase of the project, acquired a detailed knowledge of the commercial vehicle sector, the risks were low. It was also necessary to avoid further delays in order to maintain industrial interest in the requirement. The time and cost boundaries were set at Main Gate and following an advertisement placed in the MOD Contracts Bulletin, a short-list of six prime contractors was drawn up.

## A.3. Progress

The contract to procure 5,165 vehicles was signed on 31 March 2005 and this original contract was extended by a further 2,077 vehicles in July 2006. These extra vehicles were ordered following a comprehensive investment appraisal (and Review Note approval) which demonstrated it to be considerably cheaper to buy new vehicles rather than run on the best of the in-service fleet. The first 6, 9 and 15 Tonne prototype (quantity 14) vehicles were produced and have undergone formal Military trials which commenced, on schedule, on 30 October 2006.

The total Support Vehicle Programme provides 6,928 Cargo Vehicles, 288 Recovery Vehicles and 69 Recovery trailers, replacing a fleet of just under 15,000 in-service vehicles.

The In-Service date (ISD) is in two stages – the ISD for 161 Cargo Vehicles was achieved, one month early, in June 2007 and the ISD for eight Recovery Vehicles plus two Recovery Trailers was declared in February 2008.

Approximately 2,250 vehicles are now in-service, a number of which have been delivered to theatre to support current operations.£25.4M has been used to produce an Enhanced Palletised Load System (a modified variant of the 15 tonne Support Vehicle) to provide a protected vehicle with a palletised load and container handling facility to meet a capability gap. A further £16.7M has been used to up-rate the protection systems employed by the vehicles to counter the escalating threat levels.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Support Vehicle programme is procuring the tri-service Cargo, Unit Support Tanker and Recovery

Vehicles to improve military lift/distribution and recovery capability. It will replace the in-service 4, 8 and 14 Tonne cargo vehicles, the cargo trailer fleet and the in-service recovery vehicles. For cost reasons the quantity of vehicles finally purchased will not be capable of fully supporting Defence Strategic Guidance 2008 Medium Scale enduring, Medium Scale non-enduring and Small Scale non-enduring concurrent commitments - this risk has been accepted by the MOD.

The risks of not procuring the Support Vehicle capability are:

1.  The increased costs of running on the obsolescent in-service fleet.

2.  The obsolescent in-service fleet does not have the capability to provide the required levels of protection to troops in theatre.

Re-definitions resource basis (-£4m). Difference in variation figures due to revision of Cost of Capital Charge from 6 to 3.5% (+£13m). Funding for Seating Kits returned to programme (+£9m). Removal of the procurement of new Seating Kits (-£10m). Removal of Bowman Installation Kits from the programme in 2002/03 (-£33m). Change of vehicle Mix (+£20m). Option taken in 2002/03 to slip ISD & Compress delivery (+£40m). Reduced Milestone

Department review resulting in reduction of Recovery Vehicles and Seating Kits (-£18m). Department trials have been integrated with the contractor’s trials resulting in progressive acceptance, reduced trials

1.  There are 26 KPMs overall; the MPR contains an abbreviated list for simplicity.

2.  This KPM represents two Key Performance Measures, one for the Cargo vehicle and one for the Recovery vehicle. Both KPMs are forecast not to be met, and as a result this is counted twice in the MPR analysis
