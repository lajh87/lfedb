# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

The Team Complex Weapons initiative is based on meeting the UK's enduring requirement to have battle winning military capability through the use of Complex Weapons; to be assured that the weapons will perform as expected; and to retain the ability to develop leading edge Complex Weapons technologies.

Within this context, the initiative aims to deliver:

1.  Improved, adaptable and flexible Complex Weapons that can be shaped to meet current and future military capability needs;

2.  Freedom of Action and Operational Advantage in our Complex Weapons through a sustained indigenous industrial construct.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Assessment Phase

In April 2008 an Initial Gate submission was made to the Investment Approvals Board (IAB) for the

Complex Weapons Sector. This was approved in June 2008. The Business Case sought approval to

^Enter\ Text\ Here^enter a non-competitive Assessment Phase (AP) with Team Complex Weapons. The Assesssment Phase was designed to test the viability of UK Sovereign acquisition of Complex Weapons (CW) through a modular and funding pipeline approach that offered greater value for money. This was consistent with the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) in maintaining operational sovereignty of UK Complex Weapons and sustaining UK industry's specialist capabilities.

Initial work considered a number of options, ranging from non-competitive based around Team Complex Weapons to full open competition. The options were assessed on their ability to meet military capability, operational sovereignty and value for money measured against the draft Concept of Analysis. The analysis strongly indicated that the continued use of competition would progressively erode the MoD's ability to secure affordable and effective military capability and restrict future choice and decision making.

<tr>
<th>The Team Complex Weapons (TCW) proposition is founded on the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) that set out the UK's intent to preserve operational sovereignty of its Complex Weapons. The first step in assessing the viability of a UK sovereign acquistion was a non competitive Assessment Phase which was approved by the Investment Approvals Board (Initial Gate June 2008). This covered risk reduction work to develop solutions to meet the Future Air to Surface Guided Weapon (FASGW), Loitering Munition; Stormshadow Capability Enhancement Programme (SSCEP); Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS); and Selected Precision Effects at Range (SPEAR) programmes. Review Note 1 (March 2009) sought approval of a second tranche of money to continue the Assessment Phase and Review Note 2 (November 2009) sought approval for funds to conclude the Assessment Phase and to address the questions raised by the Investment Approvals Board (July/October 2009). The Assessment Phase concluded that the preferred option was a long term partnering model based on bilateral arrangements with the Team Complex Weapons Prime Contractors. With the Strategic Defence Review on the horizon Interim Main Gate 1 (March 2010) proposed entering into a shorter term Interim Portfolio Management Agreement (PMA-I) with MBDA UK. It also sought approval for expenditure to meet only immediate Complex Weapons requirements specifically:
Loitering Munition (Fireshadow) (Demonstration &amp;
Manufacture);
Selected Precision Effects at Range (SPEAR) Capability 2 Block 1 (Demonstration &amp; Manufacture) (now Brimstone 2);
Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS) (Assessment Phase);
Spear Capability 2 Block 2 (now Spiral Development) (Assessment Phase); and Spear Capability 3 (Assessment Phase) Interim Main Gate 2 was the second of three submissions which sought approval for the Demonstration Phase of the maritime element of the Future Local Area Air Defence System (Maritime). This was approved in principle by the Investment Approvals Committee in April 2011 and in December 2011 Director General Finance confirmed that it was affordable.</th>

Interim Main Gate 2 Following Investment Approvals Board approval in April 2011, Future Local Area Air Defence System (Maritime) (now officially known as Sea Ceptor) Type 23 Demonstration Phase Contract was placed in December 2011. MBDA is the prime contractor with supporting non-prime elements provided by BAE Maritime Services, Qinetiq and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL). The Preliminary Design Review was held in February/March 2012 and its successful conclusion marks a major milestone. Interim Main Gate 3 was the third of the submissions and concerned approval for the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy) Demonstration and Manufacture Phase. The Business Case was presented to Equipment Capability Secretariat on 9 January 2012 and was considered by the Investment Approvals Committee on 18 January. On 31 January Director General Finance approved the case, with a caveat that negotiations should be concluded with France before 31 March 2012. Bi-laterals continued, but by 28 March when Chief Secretary to the Treasury(CST) wrote to the MoD, discussions had not been concluded and as such Chief Secretary to the Treasury approved the case, subject to receiving French national approval. Reflecting this caveated approvals position and the absence of a final negotiated position on the Future Anti Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy) Demonstration and Manufacture Phase, standard Major Projects report practice has been followed meaning that this project is not included in later sections of this report.</th>

<th>Interim Main Gate 1 Selective Precision Effects at Range Capability 2 Block 1 (Spear Capability 2 Block 1) - Brimstone 2 - replaces the legacy Brimstone missile's energetics and airframe with a new Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliant warhead, rocket motor and an upgraded seeker and airframe. Spear Cap 2 Block 1 will replace the Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone (DMSB) capability currently in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and will be integrated onto Tornado GR4 and is intended for integration on Typhoon. Spear Capability 3 is a new 100kg class weapon. This capability will be the primary air-to-ground armament for the Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA)/F-35B Joint Strike Fighter from , and optimised for internal carriage. Spear Capability 3 will provide the means to destroy/defeat a wide range of targets at range, including mobile and re-locatable targets, in all weathers day and night, in complex environments under tight rules of engagements (ROE). The Indirect Fire Precision Attack (IFPA) programme will address the requirement to attack static and moving targets at various ranges. Within this, Loitering Munitions will focus on the most complex targets where man-in-the-loop capability is required in order to ensure mission success and minimise the potential for collateral damage. Interim Main Gate 2 The Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS) implementation will provide increased capability over Sea Wolf that addresses the capability shortfall identified in the 2009 Capability Above Water capability audits. The Future Local Area Air Defence System solution is the only candidate to fill the capability gap that is both affordable and will meet the Key User Requirements (KURs) within the required timescales.</th>

The current support approach is through individual contracts for each weapon type, e.g. Stormshadow, ASRAAM, etc. The intent in Interim Main Gate 1 was to secure a long term arrangement for In Service Support (ISS) under the Unified Support Environment (USE) with MBDA. The USE strategy has since been revised with the transfer of the explosives business stream of Joint Support Chain Services into Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) Weapons Operating Centre (WOC) and will be taken forward under the wider transformation activity required to deliver efficiencies into this business. The most recent contract with MBDA (April 2011) for the Sea Viper In Service Support arrangement will provide the benefits afforded by the Portfolio Management Agreement (Interim) including gainshare, and has the potential to act as a catalyst for ISS transformation in the longer term.

This would suggest that the Interim Main Gate 1 approval has been breached, however, in February 2009, prior to the Complex Weapons Pipeline approval, Team Complex Weapons received approval for Brimstone Insensitive Munition - £67m. The Project spent £17m on Brimstone Insensitive Munition and transferred the remainder (£50m) to Spear Capability 2 Block 1, to form part of the pipeline funding. When this additional approval is added to that in Interim Main Gate 1 (£196M) the combined approval is £246m. This gives overall approvals headroom of circa £3m.</td>

However, an initial batch of weapons systems was delivered, on time, in March 2012. These were demonstrated in June 2012 and while the success rate was lower than desired, performance of the hardware met the Loitering Munition key performance measures.
