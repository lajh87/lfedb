SEARCH and RESCUE HELICOPTER

1.  Section A: The Project

1.  the Requirement

Search and Rescue – Helicopter is a Joint MOD and Maritime &
Coastguard Agency (an Agency of the Department for Transport) Programme. It Seeks to Replace the Current Search and Rescue Capability, Provided Around the UK by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, using Sea King Helicopters, and Through the Maritime &
Coastguard Agency Service Contract.

1.  the Assessment Phase

The Search and Rescue – Helicopter Assessment Phase Was Approved in 2 Phases – Assessment Phase 1 and Assessment Phase 2. Assessment Phase 1 Considered the Range of Procurement Options as Outlined in

The Search and Rescue – Helicopter Initial Gate Approval, Resulting in a Recommendation for a Joint

MOD/Maritime and Coastguard Agency Competitive PFI Procurement Strategy. MOD Ministerial Approval for Assessment Phase 2 to Implement the Joint MOD/Maritime & Coastguard Agency Competitive PFI Procurement Strategy Was Gained via the Future Rotorcraft Capability Initial Gate Business Case and Followed by Department for Transport Ministerial Approval of a Parallel Business Case. a Joint Ministerial Announcement of the PFI Procurement Strategy Was Made in May 2006 and the Competition Was Launched Through the Official Journal of the European Union.

Four Consortia Were Short-Listed Following Assessment of their Pre Qualification Questionnaires (PQQ) in

November 2006: Augusta Westland; CHC Scotia Ltd/Thales UK Ltd (Now Known as “soteria”); AirKnight

(Lockheed Martin UK Ltd/VT Group Ltd/British International Helicopters Ltd); and UK Air Rescue (Bristow

Helicopters Ltd/FBH Ltd/Serco Ltd). the Competitive Dialogue with Industry Formally Commenced in February 2007. in October 2007 Augusta Westland Withdrew as an Independent Participant from the Competition. Westland Helicopters Ltd Was Subsequently Admitted to the UK Air Rescue Consortium in January 2008 Following the Submission of a Pre Qualification Questionnaire Addendum. Industry’s Costed Solutions for the First Round of Bidding Were Submitted in January 2008, And, Following the Withdrawal, for Commercial Reasons, of the UK Air Rescue Consortia in September 2008, the Two Remaining Consortia Submitted their Second Round Bids, Against a Refined Requirement to Utilise 12 Bases Around the UK, in November 2008.

In February 2009, the Two Consortia Issued Respective Press Releases Proposing their Search and Rescue – Helicopter Aircraft Solutions: The Airknight Consortia Selected a Single Fleet of Eurocopter EC225s; the Soteria Consortia Selected a Single Fleet of Sikorsky S-92s. Both Bidders Submitted their Final Proposals in December 2009. the Assessment Phase Concluded with Evaluation of the Final Round of Bids in January 2010, and the Soteria Consortium Was Announced as Preferred Bidder in February 2010. Assessment Phase Costs Were Split in the Ratio MOD 2/3 and MCA 1/3. All Costs in this Project Summary Sheet Relate Only to the MOD's Cost.

## A.3. Progress

Main Gate Approval Was Achieved in February 2010. the Project Was Suspended in June 2010, as Part of a Review of all Spending Decisions Taken Since January 2010 and the Review Concluded with Treasury Agreement in December 2010 that the Project Should Continue on the Basis of the Proposed Solution. in December 2010, Just Prior to the Planned Public Announcement of the Continuation, the Soteria Consortium Informed the MOD of a Possible Issue in Connection with Its Bid, and in February 2011 the Two Departments Announced that Irregularities Had Been Identified Such that it Would not be Appropriate to Proceed with the Preferred Bid, or the Current Procurement Process. the Two Departments are Currently Considering Potential Procurement Options to Meet Future Requirements for Search and Rescue Helicopters in the United Kingdom, Including Options to Maintain Continuity of Search and Rescue Helicopter Cover until New Longer-Term Arrangements can be Put in Place. Costs Incurred Since Main Gate Total £1.1m and Relate to Accrued Expenditure for Legal, Financial and Technical Advice.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The UK Search and Rescue Organisation is Derived from the UK Governments Adherence to Various National and International Maritime Conventions Dating from 1944 to 1979. Failure to Replace the Current Service Would Risk Contravening this Established Legal and Moral Duty. Consequently, the Two Organisations are Combining their Aviation Acquisition Expertise and are Considering Options to Meet the Requirement for a Replacement for the Current Service .
