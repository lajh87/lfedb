POST MAIN GATE PROJECT SUMMARY SHEET

VEHICLE CAPABILITY – PFI

Integrated Project Team Responsible:

ENGINEERING SYSTEMS SUPPORT

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Expeditionary Logistics & Support)

Senior Responsible Owner for Broader Capability: Capability Manager (Battlespace Manoeuvre)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The C Vehicle Fleet Comprises of over 4,000 Items of 100 Major Types Such as Rough Terrain Earthmoving Equipment, Specialist Engineer Construction Plant as Well as Field Material Handling Equipment. These are Held at Varying Degrees of Military Readiness and are Capable of Undertaking a Wide Range of Combat Support, Logistic and Construction Tasks. the Majority of the Fleet is Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) which Has Been Modified to Meet the Military Requirement.

The Contract Was Signed on 10 June 2005 with ALC (SPC) Limited.

The Operational Feasibility Test Was Successfully Completed and in-Service Date (ISD) Was Declared on 31 March 2006. the Remainder of the Implementation Rollout Phases Were all Completed on Time Leading to Full Service Commencement (FSC) in May 2006.

There are Now Approximately 1,500 Pieces of Equipment and Machinery on Demand in the Hands of the User in the Average Month in Support of Operations and Peacetime Training. the Equipment Refurbishment and Replacement Programme is Operating to the Schedule in the Contract.

Experience on Operations Has Identified that Spares Performance Continues to Affect Asset Availability (Key User Requirement 07). Performance Has Improved Significantly Throughout this Year and Further Corrective Action is Planned.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Initial Gate Approval Was Granted in November 2000 Based on Pre-Qualification Questionnaire Documentation from Six Consortia. Three Short-Listed Contenders Were Chosen to Receive the Invitation to Negotiate (ITN), Released in March 2001. Throughout this Period a Process Called ‘convergence’ Was Used to Acquaint Industry with the Requirement and also to Gain Feedback on Alternative Solutions. the ITN Responses Were Assessed Against Specified Criteria. at this Time, the Three Contenders Reduced to Two, as Two Bidders Combined Teams to Propose a Consolidated Bid. a Further Round of Revise and Confirm Offers Were Requested in May 2002, with Responses from the Two Consortia (Amey Lex Consortia; FastEx) in June 2002.

The Evaluation of the Two Bids (ALC and FastEx) Against the Public Sector Comparator Was Completed in Early 2003 Before Final Submission of the Main Gate Business Case to the Investment Approvals Board (IAB) in March 2003. Whilst Awaiting the IAB and Ministerial Decision, No Interaction Could Take Place with the Bidders, However, Specific Elements of the Requirement Were Reviewed to Address any Inconsistencies and Implement Additional Risk Reduction Measures. This Process Led to the Revised Preferred Bidder Documentation Published in December 2003. at the Time of Announcing the Main Gate Decision to Proceed with ALC, it Was also Recognised that a Funding Gap Had Been Created by the Constraint Placed on the Use of Indirect Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit (IR DEL) (Non-Cash) by HM Treasury. the Funding Requirements Were Addressed with ALC as the Initial Part of the Contract Negotiations and with the Directors Equipment Capability (Ground Manoeuvre) and (Expeditionary Logistics and Support) in Equipment Plan 2005.
