RECONNAISSANCE and ATTACK MK4

Integrated Project Team Responsible:

NIMROD MARITIME RECONNAISSANCE and ATTACK (MRA4)

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Under Water Effect)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 will Replace the Current Nimrod

Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK2 as the New Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 will Provide Significantly Enhanced Anti-Submarine and AntiSurface Warfare Capability Through Improved Aircraft and Sensor Performance, a Greater Degree of System Integration, Better Human Machine Interface Design and a Substantial Improvement in Availability and Supportability.

The Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 Contract for the Design, Development and Production of 21 Aircraft Was Placed with BAE Systems (then BAe) in 1996, Following an International Competition. the Contract Was Re-Negotiated in Mid 1999 and Again in Early 2002 –
when the Department Reduced the Number of Aircraft from 21 to 18. Continued Technical and Resource Problems Led to a Further Review of the Programme and in February 2003 the Department Reached an Agreement with BAE Systems to Change the Fixed Price Contract to a Target Cost Incentive Fee Contract for Design and Development, which Included Manufacture of Three Trials Aircraft, and an Option for a Further Fifteen Production Aircraft. Pending Definition of a Satisfactory Design Standard, Series Production Activities Were Limited to Those Activities Vital to the Preservation of the Essential Skill Sets Within BAE Systems and Its Supply Chain. Flight Trials are Underway with all Three Aircraft.

In July 2004, Studies Determined that the Capability of the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 Would Enable Maritime Reconnaissance Requirement to be Met with a Fleet of About 12 Aircraft and the Number to be Procured Has Been Reduced Accordingly. a Further Review of the Programme Identified Increased Production Costs and that the in-Service Date for the Capability Would Need to be Delayed in Order to Make the Programme Affordable Within Departmental Funding Constraints. a Business Case Seeking Authorisation of Commitment to Full Production Was Approved in May 2006, and the Contract Was Amended to Re-Introduce the Production Requirements in July 2006. as Part of the Approval Process the Project’s Original Key Requirements Were Redefined and Endorsed as Key User Requirements by the Investment

Approval Board and a Revised Definition of the in-Service Date Was Approved. the Initial Gate Business Case for the Assessment Phase of Future Support Was Approved in May 2005 with Main Gate Submission Now Expected Around Mid 2008.

## 3e. Operational Impact of ISD Variation

The Consequence of the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 ISD Slip is that Either the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK2 Would Remain in Service Beyond the Current Out-of-Service Date of March 2011 or a Capability Gap will be Endured. This Slip will Delay Introduction of the Improved Capability of the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 and Could Require the Ageing Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK2 Fleet to be Maintained in Service Longer than Expected. the Operational Impact of this Slippage will be Partly Mitigated by Measures Already in Hand to Introduce Upgrades to some Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK2 Systems. Notably the Acoustic Suite AQS 971, Navigation Systems, Data Links and Other Communications will Address Interoperability Issues. the Acoustic Suite Programme Has Benefited by Making Use of Acoustic Processors Procured for Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 Acoustic Suite AQS 970 Programme.

# SECTION 4: KEY USER REQUIREMENTS

Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4 is a Legacy Project and Its Original Approval Did not Include Key Requirements. the Key Requirements Reported to Date in the Major Project Report Were Retrospectively Agreed Between Director of Equipment Capability (Under Water Environment) and Nimrod Integrated Project Team Leader. Before Endorsement Was Sought, it Was Discovered that These Key Requirements Were not Compliant with the Latest Smart Acquisition Guidelines. Consequently, New Key User Requirements Were Developed from First Principles to Comply with the Latest Guidelines and Endorsed by the Investment Approvals Board in June 2006.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

In November 1992, the Equipment Approvals Committee Approved a Request for Information Exercise Whereby 17 Companies Were Invited to Provide Responses to the Draft Replacement Maritime Patrol Aircraft Staff Requirement. Following Analysis of the Industry Responses, the Equipment Approvals Committee Endorsed the Requirement and Approved an Invitation to Tender Phase Whereby Four Companies (BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Loral and Dassault) Were Invited to Provide Detailed Technical and Commercial Proposals for an Aircraft to Meet the Endorsed Staff Requirement. Dassault Withdrew from the Competition in January 1996, and Whilst Lockheed Martin and Loral Merged in May 1996, They Maintained the Two Separate Proposals until the Competition Concluded. Following Assessment of These Responses, Selection of BAE Systems’ Nimrod 2000 (Later to be Re-Designated Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack MK4) Offer Was Approved by Equipment Approvals Committee and Ministers in July 1996. This Was the Equivalent of Main Gate Approval.
