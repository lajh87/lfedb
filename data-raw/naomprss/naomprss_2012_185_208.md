## A.1 The Requirement

<th>
The Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA) is the requirement for a multi-role aircraft to be operated jointly by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy from both land bases and the new Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) has been selected as the aircraft to meet the Joint Combat Aircraft requirement, and provides the UK with a fifth generation air system. Joint Combat Aircraft will provide the UK with an expeditionary multi-role fighter with the ability to enter and operate within contested

<sup>Enter Text Here</sup>airspace. Using secure links it will operate as a Combat Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition &amp;
Reconnaissance platform providing intelligence to troops on the ground, and when required will be able to employ a range of sophisticated weaponry, even through adverse weather.</th>

## A.2 The Assessment Phase

Approval was obtained in November 1996 to enter the Concept Demonstration Phase on the Joint Strike Fighter programme under a Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 1995. The phase began in November 1996 with two competing United States Prime Contractors (Boeing and Lockheed Martin) designing and flying demonstration aircraft on which the selection of the preferred bidder was based. The phase completed in October 2001 with the announcement of Lockheed Martin as the successful bidder. ~Enter\ Text\ Here~Studies into alternative options to Joint Strike Fighter to meet the requirement were also conducted but were rejected on cost grounds. A Main Gate demonstraion approval was obtained in January 2001 for the participation in the System Development and Demonstration phase of the Joint Strike Fighter programme.

## A.3 Project History since Main Gate

Following the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, UK participation in the Concept Demonstration Phase of the programme and significant analysis, the US Joint Strike Fighter was selected to meet the Joint

Combat Aircraft requirement for Carrier Strike. A Main Gate demonstration approval was obtained in January 2001 for participation in the System Development and Demonstration phase of the JSF programme, leading to signature that month by UK and United States governments of the System Development and Demonstration Memorandum of Understanding. The selection of Lockheed Martin as the Joint Strike Fighter air system prime contractor included a teaming agreement with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to collectively form Team Joint Strike Fighter. Two separate and competitive propulsion contracts were awarded to Pratt and Whitney for the F135 engine and General Electric/Rolls Royce Fighter Engine Team for the F136 engine. In April 2011, the F135 engine was selected as the sole engine variant within the Joint Strike Fighter programme. Whilst other partners joined the programme at Level 2 and 3 entry arrangements, only United States and UK requirements have driven the System Development and Demonstration baseline solution.

In September 2002 the UK selected the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) Joint Strike Fighter variant to meet the JCA requirement. A review of the Joint Strike Fighter Programme and the viability of the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing design was completed in January 2005. It concluded that a successful programme of weight reduction initiatives and other performance enhancements had restored confidence that the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing design should remain the UK’s planning assumption. A further review by the Investment Approvals Board in July 2006 confirmed this decision.

On 12 December 2006 Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support signed the Production

Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding, which was the first of four Main Gates planned for the introduction to Service of Joint Combat Aircraft. In March 2009, approval was given for Phase 2 of the Joint Combat Aircraft incremental strategy, for participation in joint Initial Operational Test & Evaluation with the United States Services.

In October 2010 the UK Government's Strategic Defence and Security Review announced that the Joint Combat Aircraft programme would switch variant from the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variant to the Carrier Variant.

1.  formal Initial Operating Capability for Joint Combat Aircraft requirement will not be set until the Main

Gate 4 decision point. However, the Department is planning to deliver a capability from both land and sea ^Enter\ Text\ Here^that is consistent with Her Majesty's Government policy to introduce a carrier strike capability around 2020.

<tr>
<th>During financial year 2011/12 the MOD continued to pursue a Carrier Variant aircraft based programme in line with the variant change decision taken under Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010. In year progress during financial year 2011/12 focused on the following:
<ol type="1">
<li>Continuing production of three UK Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The first two of these jets have entered the final production stages and are in pre flight testing at the Lockheed Martin Fort Worth Texas production line.</li>
<li>The Joint Strike Fighter programme System Development and Demonstration phase continues at pace with a total of 2,689 flight test hours achieved through to March 24th 2012, which exceeded test point and flight targets for all variants</li>
<li>The Joint Combat Aircraft project team received approval to accommodate further years of shared programme costs and long lead funding for a fourth Joint Strike Fighter to be procured under Low Rate Initial Purchase (LRIP) contract 7</li>
<li>The United States Department Of Defense Selected Acquisition Report 11 announced a slip to the</li>
</ol>
Joint Strike Fighter programme milestone C, which represents the conclusion of System Design and Development, to April 2019. There is no cost increase to the UK contribution due to this slip, since UK contributions are fixed under the System Development and Demonstration Memorandum of Understanding. One of the most significant cost impacts reflected in the report was the US restructuring its production profile, reducing the aircraft quantity inside the US Financial Year 2013-17 timeframe by 179 aircraft, flattening the near term production rate to reflect a balanced development approach between concurrency and unit costs. The US is still committed to a total production buy of 2,443 aircraft. The Selected Acquisition Report 11 cost estimate does not affect the cost of the UK's first three aircraft but the costs of future aircraft will be affected and this impact will be considered in future approvals.</th>

1.  Capability Risks

The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010 confirmed the need for Joint Strike Fighter which forms the backbone of Carrier Enabled Power Projection. If the UK did not acquire Joint Strike Fighter it would be unable to meet its Combat Air and Carrier Enabled Power Projection requirements and be unable to support ground forces in multi threat environments at a time and place of the Government’s choosing. Joint Strike Fighter brings no significant risks to other projects, but relies heavily on the Queen Elizabeth

Carrier programme to deliver suitable carriers to introduce a Carrier Strike capability around 2020. Enter Text Here
