<th>Following the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, UK participation in the Concept Demonstration Phase of the programme and significant analysis, the US Joint Strike Fighter was selected to meet the Joint Combat Aircraft requirement for Carrier Strike. A tailored Main Gate demonstration approval was obtained in January 2001 for participation in the System Development and Demonstration phase to the value of £1,300m, along with £600m for related non-System Development and Demonstration work, leading to signature that month by UK and United State's governments of the System Development and Demonstration Memorandum of Understanding. The selection of Lockheed Martin as the Joint Strike Fighter air system prime contractor included a teaming agreement with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to collectively form Team Joint Strike Fighter. Two separate and competitive propulsion contracts were awarded to Pratt and Whitney for the F135 engine and General Electric/Rolls Royce Fighter Engine Team for the F136 engine. Whilst other partners joined the programme at Level 2 and 3 entry arrangements, only United State's and UK requirements have driven the System Development and Demonstration baseline solution. In September 2002 the UK selected the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Joint Strike Fighter variant to meet the requirement. A review of the Joint Strike Fighter program and the viability of the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing design was completed in January 2005. It concluded that a successful programme of weight reduction initiatives and other performance enhancements had restored confidence that the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing design should remain the UK’s planning assumption. A further review by the Investment Approvals Board in July 2006 confirmed this decision. On 12 December 2006 Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support signed the Production Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding , which was the first of four Main Gates planned for the introduction to Service of Joint Combat Aircraft. In March 2009, approval was given for Phase 2 of the Joint Combat Aircraft incremental strategy, for participation in joint Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation with the United States Services. This will allow the UK to fully understand and influence the Joint Strike Fighter programme as it moves into a new phase. A formal In-Service Date for Joint Combat Aircraft requirement will not be set until the Main Gate 4 decision point. However, the Department is planning to deliver a capability from both land and sea that is consistent with Her Majesty's Government policy to introduce a Carrier Strike capability around 2020.</th>

1.  The Assessment Phase

Approval was obtained in November 1996 to enter the Concept Demonstration Phase on the Joint Strike

Fighter programme under a Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 1995. The phase began in November 1996 with two competing United States Prime Contractors (Boeing and Lockheed Martin) designing and flying demonstration aircraft on which the selection of the preferred bidder was based. A tailored Main Gate demonstration approval was obtained in January 2001 for participation in the System Development and Demonstration phase. The phase completed in October 2001 with the announcement of Lockheed Martin as the successful bidder. Studies into alternative options to Joint Strike Fighter to meet the requirement were also conducted but were rejected on cost effective grounds. The options were US F/A18E aircraft, French Rafale M, a “navalised” Eurofighter Typhoon and an advanced Harrier.

<th>The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review confirmed the requirement for the Joint Strike Fighter as part of the future fast jet fleet. The MOD now plan to buy the Carrier Variant of Joint Strike Fighter, which offers advantages in terms of range, payload and through-life costs over the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variant. It also offers greater interoperability with the UK's allies. Although the MOD has decided to acquire the Carrier Variant it remains supportive of the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing programme and is still committed to the purchase of this variant of aircraft as part of the UK's contribution to a joint Initial Operational Test and Evaluation programme that is being conducted in conjunction with the US military. On the 6th January 2011 US Defense Secretary Gates announced the conclusion of the Technical Baseline Review of the Joint Strike Fighter programme. The announcement stated that:
<ol type="a">
<li>The Joint Strike Fighter System Development and Demonstration phase will be extended to complete in early 2016 (vice mid 2015).</li>
<li>System Development &amp; Demonstration costs will be increased by
$4.6bn to cover the time delay, cost escalation and the additional test effort required by the Technical Baseline Review.</li>
<li>A reduction in US production requirements of 124 aircraft over the remaining five Low Rate Production Contracts, initially with zero growth to allow the final assembly process at Lockheed Martin to mature and also to reduce the concurrency risk whilst the development programme matures.</li>
<li>The Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variant is being put "on probation" for two years. This involves decoupling of development testing, which has been problematic, from the main Joint Strike Fighter programme where Carrier Variant and Conventional Take Off and Landing variants are progressing at a faster rate. Whilst "on probation" Short Take Off and Vertical Landing production rates will be capped at six per year.</li>
</ol>
It should be noted that whilst the overall cost of the System Development Demonstration phase of the Joint Strike Fighter programme has been increased, the UK's contribution will not change and is fixed by the Memorandum of Understanding the MOD jointly signed with the US in 2001. Increases in the forecast against current approvals reflect additional studies that now need to be conducted to fully understand the wider capabilities of the Carrier Variant and to ensure coherence with the UK's specific operational sovereignty, safety and airworthiness requirements. As a result of the switch to the procurement of the Carrier Variant the Key Performance Measures reported against Short Take Off and Vertical Landing as "at risk" in MPR2010 (Key Performance Measures 03 Range and Key Performance Measures 04 Mission Performance) are now reported as "forecast to be met".</th>

1.  Capability Risks

This capability provides the UK with a fifth generation expeditionary air to ground, air to air and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition And Reconnaissance capability to satisfy the 1998 Strategic Defence Review requirement for a carrier-capable Joint Combat Aircraft. Without this capability the UK will be unable to meet its Combat Air and Carrier Strike requirements and be unable to support ground forces in multi-threat environments at a time and place of the Government’s choosing.

<td>Based on modelling and simulation results, the range capability for Joint Strike Fighter Short Take Off and Vertical Landing is approaching the specified target set for UK requirements based on UK Operating scenarios.

Further flight testing is planned to gain an accurate assessment of this potential problem and mitigation actions will be developed accordingly.</td>
