TYPE 45 DESTROYER

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability:

Director of Equipment Capability (Above Water Effect)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Type 45 is a New Class of Eight[^1] Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers, to Replace the Capability Provided by the Royal Navy’s Existing Type 42s. the Warship is Being Procured Nationally. the Type 45 will Carry the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) which is Capable of Protecting the Vessels and Ships in their Company Against Aircraft and Missiles, Satisfying the Fleet’s Need for Area Air Defence Capability into the 2030s. PAAMS is Being Procured Collaboratively with France and Italy. the Type 45 Integrated Project Team is Responsible for Providing PAAMS to the Warship Prime Contractor.

BAE Systems Electronics Was Appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999 and a Contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture (DFM) for the First Three Ships Was Placed in December 2000. a Contract for a Further Three Type 45s Was Placed with the Prime Contractor in February 2002. the Ships are Being Built under Sub-Contract by BAE Systems Naval Ships and VT Shipbuilding.

The Past Year Has Seen Significant Progress in the Manufacture of the Six Ships. All Ships are Now in Production Following the Cutting of Steel for the Sixth Ship in January 2007. the Second Ship (HMS Dauntless) Was Launched January 2007 and the Third Ship (HMS Diamond) is Scheduled for Launch in November 2007. the First of Class (HMS Daring) Has Now Been Fitted with Most of Her Equipment and is Planned to Start Sea Trials this Year.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Type 45 Destroyer Programme Builds on the Assessment Work Carried Out in Phase 1 of the Collaborative HORIZON Project, the Warship Element of the Common New Generation Frigate Programme. Following the Decision of the Three HORIZON Partners (France, Italy and the United Kingdom) to Proceed with PAAMS, but to Pursue National Warship Programmes, BAE Systems Was Appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999. the Contract for PAAMS Full Scale Engineering Development and Initial Production Was Placed in August 1999. Main Gate Approval for

The Warship Was Achieved in July 2000 and a Contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture Was Placed in December 2000.

^\^ the Assessment Phase Costs Approved at Initial Gate Did not Take into Account that all Expenditure on the WR21 Engine Was to be Treated as Assessment Costs Rather than Manufacturing Costs.

1.  T45 Destroyer is a Legacy Project that Drew Upon the Concept Work of Project Horizon and Future Frigate. T45 Did not Formally Go Through Initial Gate, but for MPR2000, the NAO Agreed that EP11/91 Should be Equated as Initial Gate for T45.

2.  This Aligns with the Derived Date for Initial Gate Above. T45 is a Legacy Project Building on the Assessment Work Carried Out in Phase 1 of the Collaborative Horizon Project..
