• Support/Service/PFI - Availability Transformation Tornado Aircraft Contract, RB199 Operational Contract for Engine Transformation

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The UK Tornado fleet is fundamental to the delivery of air power into the future. The GR4 (strike attack/reconnaissance) and F3 (air defence) aircraft require support until their Out-of Service Dates. Meeting new funding targets resulted in making the original support solution unaffordable and a partnering approach with BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce Defence Aerospace was selected to reduce the cost of Tornado support by more than half. A single contract was placed with each company to provide platform and engine availability. These contracts provide the required support until the aircraft Out-of Service Date and meanwhile are flexible to changes in Defence planning.

The requirement is to deliver an integrated support solution for the Tornado GR4 and F3 fleets. The solution must meet the authorised and funded requirements for training and operations and facilitate the cost-effective insertion of new capability. The scope of the support service must include the provision of on-aircraft depth support and off-aircraft spares, repair, training and technical support. Key to this is the need to provide depth support to sustain operational deployments and this is a fundamental building block of the new contracts.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase – not applicable

## A.3. Progress

The Availability Transformation Tornado Aircraft Contract (ATTAC) was let on 21 December 2006 with a second phase to complete the scope in November 2007. It is a life of type contract with five years’ firm pricing then five years’ fixed pricing with re-pricing and re-negotiation of the contract at five yearly intervals. The first renegotiation is due in December 2011. Within the funding available, the contract was constrained to an average 80% of required flying task over the ten years, with an aspiration to increase if and when funding becomes available.

The RB199 Operational Contract for Engine Transformation (ROCET) was let on 14 December 2005 for five years and requires re-negotiation by December 2010.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Failure of either the Availability Transformation Tornado Aircraft Contract or RB199 Operational Contract for Engine Transformation would severely impact the availability of Tornado aircraft to the front line and support to operations.

The contracts are for total system availability, allocating integration risk where it is best managed and offering the best prospect of significant improvement in output via open book arrangements for joint partnering agreements. Risk and its associated price contingency allowance is cascaded to the suppliers, not held or duplicated by BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce Defence Aerospace. Both companies have a significant footprint with a small number of suppliers supporting the majority of sub-systems across a number of platforms. This potential will be exploited through aggregation of the requirement to achieve maximum leverage and best value. Incentivisation, by linking profit and performance, will be used to achieve low maintenance down times and high reliability.
