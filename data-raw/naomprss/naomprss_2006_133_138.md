Integrated Project Team Responsible:

ENGINEER TANK SYSTEMS

Single Point of Accountability for project capability: Director Equipment Capability (Ground Manoeuvre)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

The project is intended to deliver new vehicles which will provide an armoured engineer capability to meet the Customer’s requirements. Two different vehicles are being acquired: TITAN which is an armoured bridgelayer and TROJAN which is an armoured obstacle breaching vehicle. They will replace the Chieftain vehicles which are over 30 years old, and are the first purpose-built engineer vehicles to be procured since the Second World War. They are based on the Challenger 2 hull, but have a variety of specialist equipment added. They have very high levels of both mobility and protection and are fitted for (but not with) remote operation.

The contract was let in March 2001 and the first production vehicle (of 66) was delivered in October

2005\. Training of the training staff began in January 2006 and In Service Date is forecast for October 2006. The project has suffered some delay and cost-growth from the decision to fit Bowman during production build, rather than Clansman, but the effects of this have been quantified and are reflected in the project data.

Key events in the short and medium term are the conduct of reliability growth trials in the first half of this year, together with the delivery of the necessary support elements (spares, training, publications etc.) to support the vehicles at In Service Date.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Requirements were endorsed in May 1996 approving a future Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineer (AVRE) and a future Armoured Vehicle Launcher Bridge (AVLB) against an in-service date of 2001 with funding of £2.6m for a study. The estimated procurement costs were £117.5m.

The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) process and the entry into the competition of the Polish company OBRUM delayed the programme. In July 1998, the Equipment Approvals Committee endorsed a revised maximum cost of £8.5m for the next phase, and moved the in-service date to April 2006. Contracts, to include competitive bids for demonstration and manufacture, were then let to Vickers Defence Systems (VDS), Alvis and OBRUM. When the studies concluded in February 2000 the results offered a wide variety of potential solutions including the conversion of Challenger 1 tanks; new vehicles; modified Challenger 2 vehicles and “off the shelf” Polish engineer tanks with various levels of modification. It was concluded that VDS were offering the most cost effective solution with clear technical and scheduling advantages. VDS were announced as the preferred bidder in August 2000 and Main Gate approval was gained in January 2001.
