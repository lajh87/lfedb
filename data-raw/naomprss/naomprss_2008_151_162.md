# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Typhoon, Formerly Known as Eurofighter, is an Agile Multi-Role Combat Aircraft. Originally Designed Primarily, but not Exclusively, for Air Superiority the Aircraft is also Capable of Delivering a Precision Ground Attack Capability. Typhoon Has the Flexibility to Respond to the Uncertain Demands of the Current Strategic Environment and is Progressively Replacing the Tornado F3 and Jaguar Aircraft.

The Aircraft is Being Developed, Produced and Supported in a Collaborative Project with

Germany, Italy and Spain. the Project is Managed on Behalf of the Four Partner Nations by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency. the Contract for the First Tranche of 148 Aircraft, of which 55 Valued at some £2.5bn are for the UK, Was Signed in September 1998. the Contract for the Second Tranche Comprising 236 Aircraft, 89 of which are for the UK, Was Placed in December 2004. Negotiations are Underway with Industry and Nations on the Third Tranche of 236 Aircraft (88 for the UK). the Estimated Current Cost of Typhoon Was Classified in MPR05 and Remains so in MPR08, in Order to Protect the UK’s Ability to Negotiate for the Third Tranche.

Typhoon Has Been in Service with the Royal Air Force for Five Years and Commenced Operational Duties for the First Time in June 2007 when it Assumed Quick Reaction Alert Responsibility for Defence of Southern UK Airspace (Jointly with Tornado F3 on Rotation until April 2008). the Second Operational Squadron, No.11 (Fighter) Squadron, Formed in March 2007 and Deliveries of Tranche 1 Aircraft Were Completed in December 2007. Deployable Air Defence Operational Status Was Achieved on 1 January 2008, which Enables Typhoon to Deploy Worldwide on Air-to-Air Missions.

A Contract Was Placed in July 2006 for an Initial Precision Air-to-Surface Capability on Royal Air Force Typhoons. This will be Implemented by Mid-2008, in Advance of a more Comprehensive Air-to-Surface Package Through the Typhoon Future Capability Programme for which a Contract Was Signed in March 2007.

The First Export Customer, Austria, Signed a Procurement Contract in July 2003 which Was Amended in 2007 (18 Aircraft Reduced to 15);
Deliveries to Austria Began in 2007. the Agreement for the Sale of 72 Typhoon Aircraft to Saudi Arabia, with Associated Support and Training Programmes, Was Signed in September 2007. Contract Acceptance of Aircraft for Saudi Arabia will Commence in 2009. Further Export Prospects Have Been Identified and the Department (in Conjunction with the Partner Nations and Industry) is Supporting a Number of Export Campaigns.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Pre-Development, which Commenced with the Approval of the Feasibility Study in 1984, Comprised a Number of Activities. Following Early Concept Studies, and Various Efforts at Establishing a Collaborative Programme, There Were Two Key Typhoon Demonstration Activities Completed by the UK Before Development: The Experimental Aircraft Programme, an Airframe Programme Primarily Aimed at Proving the Feasibility of the Typhoon Unstable Flight Control Concepts, and the XG40 Engine Demonstrator Programme at Rolls Royce. the Results of These Demonstrators and their Associated Studies, Together with the Results of Similar Work Within the Other Nations Were Harmonised in a Definition, Refinement and Risk Reduction Phase that Ran from the End of 1985 when Four Nations Signed the Initial Memorandum of Understanding, until 1988 when the Development Contract Was Signed.

## 5b. Cost of the Assessment Phase
