• Post Main Investment Decision - Terrier

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Terrier is required to be a highly mobile, robust and reliable armoured earthmoving vehicle, which will support mobility, counter mobility and survivability throughout the spectrum of conflict. It will be optimised for battlefield preparation and used by Close Support Engineer units. Terrier is being procured to replace the capability provided by the Combat Engineer Tractors.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

A funded feasibility study for Terrier concluded that the most cost-effective way of meeting the requirement was to develop a new vehicle, where possible integrating in-service sub-systems and commercial off-the-shelf equipment. Approval was given for a competitive Project Definition phase in August 1998 and Firm Price contracts were placed in August 1999 with BAE Systems (with the work undertaken by its subsidiary Royal Ordnance plc) and Vickers Defence Systems. Both contractors developed detailed designs making extensive use of Computer Aided Design tools, virtual reality modelling, rigs and trials. The capabilities required and constraints imposed by physical limitations, such as rail and air transportability, resulted in very similar technical solutions. Both contractors offered tracked vehicles close in size weight and mobility to the Warrior tracked infantry fighting vehicle, having a crew of two and providing protection against small arms, high explosive fragments and mines. An Invitation to Tender was issued in February 2001 to both companies which sought detailed proposals and prices for all later phases. The Invitation to Tender also adopted Smart Acquisition initiatives such as Progressive Acceptance and innovative Contractor Logistic Support proposals. The Main Gate Business Case was approved on 17 July 2002. The contract for Demonstration, Manufacture and Phase one Contractor Logistic Support was placed with Royal Ordnance plc on 19 July 2002.

## A.3. Progress

Delays in the construction of the Demonstrator Vehicles and slower than expected reliability improvement on the Prototype Vehicle led to BAE Systems entering contractual default in September 2007. The resulting rectification programme submitted by BAE Systems resulted in a slip to In Service Date of 27 months. This was noted by the Investment Appraisal Board in May 2008. BAE Systems adhered to their rectification proposal and successfully completed the work required to support production release (Milestone 12) in August 2008. In parallel with this work the Department and BAE Systems were exploring methods to increase the survivability of the vehicle and reduce the risk of not achieving vehicle reliability within its weight budget. A Review Note to outline programme options was submitted to the Investment Appraisal Board which instructed the project to explore further the option of increasing vehicle survivability. A mutually agreed 60 day suspension of production release was agreed while BAE Systems carried out a technical, cost and programme feasibility study. This review provided a maximum cost for vehicle modifications which has been managed by a combination of reducing vehicle quantities from 65 to 60, a compensatory adjustment for moving Liquidated Damages in line with a revised delivery programme and an additional £9m programme cost increase. The programme impact of this change is an additional

16 month slip to ISD. Following a further approval, release to production along with a contract amendment agreement to incorporate the survivability and reliability risk reduction measures was signed on 09 December 2008. A final contract amendment converting agreed Maximum prices to Firm was signed off on 27 March 2009 though this had no fundamental impact on the programme costs.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The existing capability that Terrier replaces is Combat Engineer Tractor. However, Combat Engineer Tractor was withdrawn from service in 2008 as a savings measure since safety, obsolescence and reliability issues made it unlikely to be deployed on operations. A Capability Investigation conducted by the customer concluded that there was no single equipment available off the shelf or under Urgent Operational Requirement procedures that could be procured to fill the gap between Combat Engineer Tractor’s removal from service and the In Service Date of Terrier.

Terrier will provide a highly agile, robust earthmoving capability which will have utility across the continuum of operations from warfighting to peace support. Reported in last years NAO Report, High Mobility Engineering Excavators from JCB will be deployed on current operations as part of the Talisman programme. Talisman will provide a new military capability in support of Combat Logistic Patrols. High Mobility Engineering Excavators were selected for Talisman specifically for their optimal blend of sustained convoy speed and protection levels commensurate with other protected patrol vehicles in the Talisman fleet. High Mobility Engineering Excavators’ function within Talisman is limited to the repair and improvement of routes during clearance and proving operations on supply routes, involving long journeys by road between tasks. High Mobility Engineering Excavators’ role is specific to the support of Combat Logistic Patrols and is not a requirement that Terrier has been designed for. In particular tracked armoured vehicles such as Terrier are optimised for cross country travel not long journeys by road.

In addition to High Mobility Engineering Excavator, Engineering Plant with enhanced protection are being utilised in lower threat areas where mobility and speed are less essential. Whilst High Mobility Engineering Excavator or other engineering plant may have some utility in other roles their designs fall significantly short of the levels of cross country mobility , protection and functionality designed into Terrier and make them capable of meeting only two of the 11 Key User Requirements ( KURs 05 & 06 ) that Terrier has been designed to meet.

The user has accepted an extended capability gap due to the time required to increase the Terrier platforms’ mine protection levels as a result of lessons learnt on current operations. On future operations Terrier will be deployed to support a range of high mobility vehicles such as Challenger 2, Warrior, Viking and Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance Tracked on severe terrain and to open and create routes in high threat environments to allow these vehicles greater flexibility in manoeuvre and engagement.

<th colspan="5">The Terrier Support solution is an integral part of the Demonstration &amp; Manufacture contract. The Main Gate Investment Appraisal concluded that Contractor Logistic Support was no cheaper than traditional support but risk transfer to Industry was a significant benefit to the Department. Additionally the incentive for the contractor to meet the reliability requirements for the system was increased due to a large cost element of support being driven by spares consumption and hence system reliability. Elements transferred to industry include System Obsolescence, Safety and Configuration Management of Vehicles, Training Equipment, Technical Documentation &amp; Special Tools. Spares provision and refurbishment of repairable units to meet specified demand levels are also included in a fixed price five year service provision. The Contractor Logistic Support option was taken on the 09 December 2008 along with the Manufacture option.</th>

Terrier will provide a highly agile, robust earthmoving capability which will have utility across the continuum of operations from warfighting to peace support. Terrier replaces the Combat Engineer Tractor which was removed from service in March 2008 despite further delays to the Terrier programme. Restrictions on the Combat Engineer Tractor, primarily due to Bowman system safety concerns, reliability and industrial obsolescence had, in effect, already initiated a capability gap as Combat Engineer Tractor is not deployed on current operations. The subsequent delay to Terrier’s ISD extends the capability gap and removes contingent capability manoeuvre support until 2013. Modifications to the vehicle to meet current mine threats will significantly increase crew survivability in current theatres of operation. The User acknowledges the operational risk of the ISD variation and accepts the delay to the Terrier programme.

The Investment Approvals Board have approved an increase in time to perform digging tasks for these KPMs. This does not remove the functionality to perform the specified task. Instead, the approval allows BAE Systems the flexibility to manage reliability issues in future phases of Demonstration, by reducing mechanical stresses in the system. As yet, this flexibility to increase time to perform digging tasks for these KPMs has not been utilised. As a result these KPMs have been classed as at risk

The definitions of KPMs 5 and 6 have been revised. Route Marker System has been removed from the vehicle definitions of KPM 5 (Battleweight) and KPM 6 (Deployable by Air). The system is being procured as a fitted for but not with item (optional) and should not be considered as an integral part of the vehicle. This was accepted by Customer.

The air transportability of Terrier has been successfully addressed by the A400M Integrated Project Team through the placing of a contract amendment with Airbus Military Sociedad Limitada for a Locally Reinforced Cargo Floor. Terrier must be air transportable. Verification criteria requires this to be demonstrated in A400M. The A400M cargo floor loading study shows that it is possible to modify the floor to take Terrier.
