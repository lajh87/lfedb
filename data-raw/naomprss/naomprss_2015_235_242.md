# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent Cm 6994, to maintain a Continuous At Sea Nuclear Deterrent by means of a new class of submarine. This will replace the current Vanguard class as it comes out of service.

The submarines are part of the MOD's committed core equipment programme as announced by the Secretary of State on 14th May 2012. An investment decision is expected in 2016.

The Successor boats are expected to have a 25 year life with the option of at least a five year extension and suitable low detectability. The current planned service entry date for the first boat is 2028.

A Common Missile Compartment for the submarine is being developed with the United States. This will house the Trident Strategic Weapon System.

Next Generation Nuclear Propulsion Plant: At Initial Gate in April 2011, the decision was taken to power the submarine with a nuclear propulsion system known as Pressurised Water Reactor 3 (PWR3) which incorporates the latest safety technologies and ensures the boats have the performance to deliver the United Kingdom's minimum credible nuclear deterrent out to the 2060s.

The Nuclear Propulsion Critical Technology programme brings focused investment to regenerate the UK nuclear propulsion design and support capability, and ensures we have the design base essential to maintain a strategic sovereign UK nuclear capability.

The Wider Programme: The Strategic Defence and Security Review concluded that it would be possible to defer decisions on the replacement of both the warhead and infrastructure elements of the programme. Over the next few years concept studies will begin to refine potential programmes and costs. No decision as to whether a new warhead design is needed will be taken until the next Parliament. Neither the warhead nor infrastructure is covered in this report.

The Rolls-Royce Core Production Capability facility at Raynesway has passed Main Gate and will provide the fuel cores for Successor. This is covered by a separate Project Summary Sheet.

.

## A.2. Assessment Phase History

The MOD's Future Submarines Project Team was established in 2007 from a small group within the then

Nuclear Directorate. Three companies, BAE Submarine Solutions (Platform), Babcock (support), and Rolls-Royce (power plant) known as the Tier One industrial partners were awarded contracts for the collaborative Concept Phase. This work informed the Options considered at Initial Gate. An example was the selection of Pressurised Water Reactor 3 as the submarine's propulsion system. Pressurised Water Reactor 3 provides superior performance and meets the Nuclear Safety Regulator's requirement to continually improve our performance and meet the "As Low As Reasonably Practicable" requirement. However Pressurised Water Reactor 3 is more expensive to buy and operate over a 25 year period, but cheaper if the boats are run for longer. During the Concept Phase, the 2010 SDSR Strategic Defence and Security Review deferred the planned delivery of the first submarine from 2024 to 2028, and deferred the Main Gate decision point from 2014 to 2016. There was also agreement with the United States on the major parameters of the jointly-developed common missile compartment design that will be capable of carrying the current Trident D5 missiles and any replacement missile once the D5 reaches the end of its expected life in the 2040s. The Initial Gate Business Case also considered the Submarine design using pull through of Astute technology to reduce cost and design and delivery risk, and provide commonality in training and maintenance. There were also opportunities to take advantage of developments since the Astute design.

Following SDSR 10, the Initial Gate Business Case was submitted to run a 69 month Assessment Phase at a cost of £3.015Bn. Treasury approved the Case on 29th March 2011, the IAC issued an approval letter on 14th April 2011 and an announcement was made in Parliament on 18 May 2011 following publication of a Report to Parliament, "The United Kingdom's Future Nuclear Deterrent: The Submarine Initial Gate Parliamentary Report".

Immediately following approval, design activities commenced under an extension of the Concept contract while the full Design Phase and Engineering services framework contracts were finalised and signed with BAE Submarine Solutions and Babcock on 13th December 2011. These cover the period up to Main Gate and consist of an overarching framework structure with rolling waves of task packages. A contract amendment to align with these contracts was also placed with Rolls-Royce. A Collaborative Agreement between all three companies and the MOD was also signed. This governs the relationships between industrial parties’
performance and profit retention. An Integrated Master Schedule has been developed pulling into one the schedules from BAES, Rolls Royce, and Babcock Marine.

The Ship Specification, which decomposes the user requirement into specific requirements for each submarine system and attribute, has been fully developed and placed under configuration control with the exception of Outfitting Requirements. The first phase of the platform detailed design programme, Design Intent Definition which confirms the system architectures, completed to plan in December 2012 with a major design review (System Definition Review, SDR) across all of the major systems areas. During December 2012, the Annual Report to Parliament was submitted and in March 2013, the MoD Investment Approvals Committee approved the build strategy for the Common Missile Compartment.

In December 2012, the IAC and HMT approved bringing forward post-Main Gate platform funding amounting to £261M - £55M for additional long lead material purchases and £201M to commit to facilities upgrades at the BAES Barrow boat yard. The bring forward is not additional funding; the total cost of the programme remains the same, it is purely a bring forward of programmed funding post MG into the IG period, therefore no programme cost growth overall. This is early expenditure to de-risk the programme. Separately, £3M of platform approval was provided to Next Generation Nuclear Propulsion Plant (NGNPP) to pay for additional contractor assistance in the US.

## A.3. In-Year Progress

The platform entered design stage in July 2014; this sees the spatial arrangements developed. A wholeboat Preliminary Design Review was held in November 2014 and the Pressurised Water Reactor 3 (PWR3) Critical Design Review in December 2014. Achievement of the latter two Reviews was within a week of the date set 3 years previously.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Without the design and build of a new class of ballistic missile submarines, the United Kingdom would be unable to maintain its independent nuclear deterrent once the current Vanguard class goes out of service. This decision was agreed by Parliament in 2007 following the 2006 White Paper: "The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent"
Cm 6994. The current Government also supports the maintenance of the United Kingdom’s independent Nuclear Deterrent capability.

The change in threat environment during Vanguard’s in-service life have inevitably given rise to the need for a more capable replacement submarine to achieve the same levels of deterrence, particularly with regard to detectability. With the capability envelope having been set with the choice of submarine characteristics at Initial Gate, and given current levels of design maturity, opportunities to save cost against Successor through further capability trading is limited without affecting schedule and therefore cost and time. Economies in manufacture through efficiency at the build yard, management of the supply chain, and simplification of the detailed design will be considered, and economies in the wider submarine enterprise will also be exploited wherever possible to reduce cost.

The Nuclear Deterrent is a current Operation.

The aim is for affordable Through Life Support with established Whole Life Costs and challenging availability targets, within the constraint of the design which is not optimised for Through Life Costs. The target is to have a Whole Life Cost that does not exceed that of the current Vanguard class and ensure maintenance of the Continuous At Sea Deterrent. Drivers for change include: Long term supply chain incentivisation and reductions in design complexity and component range and scale. Babcock is the Tier 1 company for support, and the strategy will be delivered as a collaborative activity within the Submarine Enterprise Performance Programme.</td>

Changes have been made to the split of the approval between the Projects with Future

Submarines transferring approval to Nuclear Propulsion (NP). Increases are due to NP costs for Primary and Secondary Plant as design progresses.
