# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Typhoon, Formerly Known as Eurofighter, is an Agile Multi-Role Combat Aircraft. Originally Designed for Air Superiority the Aircraft will also be Capable of Delivering a Precision Ground Attack Capability. Typhoon will Have the Flexibility to Respond to the Uncertain Demands of the Current Strategic Environment and will Enable the Royal Air Force to Replace Progressively the Tornado F3 and Jaguar Aircraft.

The Aircraft is Being Developed in a Collaborative Project with Germany, Italy and Spain, and is Managed on Behalf of the Nations by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA). the Contract for the First Tranche of 148 Aircraft, of which 55 Valued at some £2.5bn are for the United Kingdom, Was Signed in September 1998. the Second Tranche Comprising 236 Aircraft, 89 of which are for the United Kingdom, Was Placed on Contract in December 2004. a Decision on the Third Tranche of 232 Aircraft (88 for the UK) is not Required Before at Least 2007. the Estimated Current Cost of Typhoon Was Classified in MPR05 and Remains so in MPR06, in Order to Protect the UK’s Ability to Negotiate for Subsequent Buys of the Aircraft.

The in Service Date (ISD) of June 2003, Forecast in MPR03, Was Achieved. Deliveries of the Aircraft to the RAF are Continuing to Make Good Progress and the First Typhoon Wing at RAF Coningsby Was Inaugurated in July 2005. This Has Been Followed by the Formation of the First Operational Squadron, No.3 (Fighter) Squadron, on 31 March 2006.

The Air Forces of the Four Partner Nations are in the Process of Evaluating, Training and Converting to this Aircraft Type. This will Allow this Adaptable Weapons System to be Fully Integrated into their Respective Force Structures. the First in-Service Firings of Advanced Short Range Air to Air Missile (ASRAAM) on Typhoon Took Place in May 2005 and the RAF Successfully Deployed Typhoon to the United States for Trials Work, Including the Firing of Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM) in Late 2005.

Potential Export Customers Have Been Identified and the Department (in Conjunction with the Typhoon Partner Nations and Industry) is Supporting a Number of Export Campaigns.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Pre-Development, which Commenced with the Approval of the Feasibility Study in 1984, Comprised a Number of Activities. Following Early Concept Studies, and Various Efforts at Establishing a Collaborative Programme, There Were Two Key Typhoon Demonstration Activities Completed by the UK Before Development: The Experimental Aircraft Programme (EAP), an Airframe Programme Primarily Aimed at Proving the Feasibility of the Typhoon Unstable Flight Control Concepts, and the XG40 Engine Demonstrator Programme at Rolls Royce. the Results of These Demonstrators and their Associated Studies, Together with the Results of Similar Work Within the Other Nations Were Harmonised in a Definition, Refinement and Risk Reduction Phase that Ran from the End of 1985 when Four Nations Signed the Initial Memorandum of Understanding, until 1988 when the Development Contract Was Signed.
