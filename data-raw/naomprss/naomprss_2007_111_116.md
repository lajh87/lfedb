# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

An all-Weather, 24 Hour, General-Purpose Bombing Requirement which Offered Increased Accuracy to Reduce Collateral Damage Was Identified During the 1991 Gulf War and Re-Emphasised in Subsequent Operations. the Precision Guided Bomb (PGB) Programme Was Established to Meet this Requirement and Raytheon Systems Limited (RSL), Who Offered the Paveway IV Weapon, Was Selected as the Prime Contractor Following International Competition. Investment Approvals Board (IAB) Approval Was Given in June 2003 for the Procurement of the Weapon System and Integration Onto Harrier, Tornado and Typhoon Aircraft. Contract Let Was Planned for September 2003, However Departmental Funding Constraints Delayed Contract Let and Limited it to Placement of the Main Weapon, Support and Harrier GR9 Integration Contracts. These Contracts Were Let in December 2003. Following the Approval of PGB Integration Onto Typhoon as Part of the Future Capability Programme (FCP) in January 2007, the Integration Funding Was Transferred from PGB IPT to Typhoon IPT. a Further Submission will be Made Once the Way Forward for Tornado Integration Becomes Clear.

Since Contract Let LASER Capability Has Been Added at No Cost to the MoD. All Milestones Have Been Achieved; ‘risk Reduction’ Drops in 2006 Were Successful, the Weapon System Certificate of Design Issued January 2007 and Live Weapon Capability Trials Started at China Lake.

Work Continues Across the Stakeholder Community to Deliver Capability Across all Lines of

Development in Order to Meet the Declared in-Service Date (ISD). the PGB Programme is Entering Its Final Phase of Development and is Currently Progressing Qualification of the Weapon System with the Aim of Delivering Paveway IV by the ISD.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Purpose of the Assessment Phase Was to Select the Preferred Bidder to Take Forward to Main Gate. Invitations to Tender Were Released to Six Companies in October 2001 and Six Formal Tenders Were Received. a Two-Stage Assessment Phase Resulted in MBDA and Raytheon Systems Limited Being Taken Forward into the Final Phase of the Competition. a Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisal (COEIA) Was Undertaken by Dstl and a Technical and Commercial Assessment of the Tenders Was Undertaken by the PGB IPT and Its Specialist Stakeholders (Including QinetiQ and BAE Systems).

The Main Gate Business Case Was Approved in June 2003. Raytheon Systems Limited, Who Offered the Paveway IV Weapon to Meet the PGB Requirement, Was Selected as the Preferred Contractor.
