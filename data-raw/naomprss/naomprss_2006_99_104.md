## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

PANTHER is Based on an Italian IVECO Designed Vehicle and is Being Upgraded to United Kingdom Specification by BAE Land Systems. It is Required to Provide Protected Tactical Mobility, Enabling Users from the Combat, Combat Support and Combat Service Support Arms to Carry Out their Roles Across the Spectrum of Conflict. Panther will Provide Levels of Crew Protection and Mobility Commensurate with their Roles in an Increasingly Extended Ground Manoeuvre Area. It will Offer Protection Against Small Arms, Blast and Anti-Personnel Mines and Contain a Self-Defence Weapon (SDW) that can be Operated under-Armour to Provide Suppressive Fire. a Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) System will be Provided to Enhance Situational Awareness, Reconnaissance, Targeting and Reporting.

The Main Gate Business Case Recommended the Alvis Vickers Limited Multirole Light Vehicle (MLV) for Demonstration and Manufacture of 486 Vehicles with an in Service Date (ISD) of November 2007. This Was Approved in July 2003. However, Equipment Plan 2004 Affordability Options Reduced the Procurement Quantity to 401. the Contract Was Placed with BAE Systems Land Systems (Formerly Alvis Vickers Limited) in November 2003.

Panther ISD is Defined as a Brigade in 3(UK) Division Equipped, Trained and Ready for Operations. the Current Approved ISD is November 2007.

The Required Levels of Ballistic and Mine Blast Protection for the Platform Has Been Demonstrated. a Fully Representative Vehicle Was Tested Against a 6kg Anti Tank Mine and Results Indicated that the Crew Would Survive. the Overhead Weapon Station is Providing Good Surveillance and Self-Defence Capability.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

In the Assessment Phase Risk Reduction Studies and Trials Were Conducted by QinetiQ and the Armoured

Trials and Development Unit (ATDU) to Assess the Suitability for Role, Technical Compliance with System Requirement Document (SRD), Initial Reliability and Human Factors of all the Contenders. There Were Five Contenders, Scarab and IVECO Multi-Role Light Vehicle (MLV) from Alvis, RG31M and RG32M from Vickers and the French ACMAT Ranger from United Defence. on Completion of the Trials Scarab and RG31M Were Withdrawn from the Competition. Whilst all Met the Key User

Requirements and Mandatory Requirement and Were above the Required Capability Threshold, Ranger Was the Most Capable.

The Final Analysis of the Three Remaining Bids Showed that all Three Companies Were Capable of Delivering the Programme and Achieving the Key User Requirements. However, RG32M Just Met the Required Capability, with Ranger Being the Most Capable but Unaffordable and the ALVIS/IVECO MLV Coming a Close Second in Capability Terms but with the Best Support Solution (both Conventional and Contractor Logistic Support) and also Commercially Stronger than United Defence.

The Alvis IVECO MLV Was Recommended as the Preferred Solution.
