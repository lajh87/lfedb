• Post Main Investment Decision – Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme will update 30 Merlin Mk1 aircraft to overcome existing and forecast obsolescence within the Weapon System Avionics to ensure sustainment of the required capability until the planned Out of Service Date (2029). The converted aircraft will be known as the Merlin Mk2.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

Following approval of the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme Initial Gate Business Case, the Assessment Phase contract was placed in June 2003. The main Assessment Phase activities comprised:

-   Analysis of the User Requirements and development of a consolidated set of system requirements in the form of a Systems Requirements Document.

-   Production of System and Sub-System design requirements, and seeking initial costed proposals from potential suppliers.

-   Conducting trade-off studies to identify the best value solution where options exist.

-   Developing a coherent plan for Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme, aligned to other existing and planned Merlin programmes.

-   Undertaking Integrated Test, Evaluation and Acceptance planning.

-   Identification of the risks to the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme, and the identification and implementation of mitigation action to reduce the impact to an acceptable level.

-   Produce documentation and costed proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase. • Undertaking initial Integrated Logistic Support activities to define a solution compliant with the evolving Support Solution Envelope.

Future Rotorcraft Capability Review

During the Assessment Phase, MOD embarked on a review of all future rotorcraft requirements under the title of the Future Rotorcraft Capability review. The Demonstration & Manufacture Proposal that had been provided by Industry and the associated business case were produced before the impact of the Future Rotorcraft Capability review was known. The Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme was reviewed as part of the wider Future Rotorcraft Capability programme. The Future Rotorcraft Capability programme determined that the balance of financial investment over the first four years of the Equipment Programme between Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme and Lynx Wildcat should be on a 50/50, 30/70, 30/70, 30/70 basis respectively.

To allow Industry to continue critical path activity and to support the reprogramming activities resulting from Future Rotorcraft Capability, the Future Rotorcraft Capability programme provided Transition Phase funding (six months) to the Merlin Integrated Project Team for an extension to the Assessment Phase contract.

A further transition phase (six months) was required to again sustain programme momentum, align it with wider Future Rotorcraft Capability requirements and maintain programme viability during the approvals process.

## A.3. Progress

The programme remains on track, following successful completion of the Training System Design Reviews (April and September 2009). The production of the trials aircraft has commenced and is on track for first flight in January-March 2011.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Merlin Mk1 is responsible for delivering protection to the Royal Navy’s fleet from sub surface threats. It also provides a significant contribution to their overall situational awareness both above and below the water. The programme is designed to sustain the capability out to the current Out of Service Date. Without this programme the ability to detect sub-surface threats would be reduced or if the obsolescence issues were addressed through an alternate strategy (piecemeal approach) lead to a large increase in Through Life Costs.

## A.7. Support Strategy

The support strategy of the Merlin Mk2 will be the same as that employed for the current UK Merlin

(Mk1 & Mk3), namely Integrated Merlin Operational Support contract. Integrated Merlin Operational Support is a whole life aircraft availability contract that is priced by flying hours within a defined band with incentives to generate fit-for purpose aircraft to the Front Line. There are five key elements of the Integrated Merlin Operational Support Service:

Service Management

Aircraft Provision

Materiel Support

Technical Support

Training

It is a 25 year contract (commenced in 2006) and priced in five year tranches. The current pricing period has an approval of \\\. While providing support to the majority of the Merlin helicopter, there are exclusions, namely the engines and other common use items that are supported elsewhere.

Affordability decision taken prior to contract award meant that the ability to train Mk1 personnel concurrently with conversion of the training facilities to the Mk2 standard was not possible. This gives rise to the risk that trained personnel will not be available to sustain Mk1 capability to its out of service and develop those required for Mk2.
