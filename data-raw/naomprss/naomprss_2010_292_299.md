Systems. This is a significant package of work which will be carried out at BAE Systems’ factory in Newcastle; the current completion date for this is February 2012. Full Operating Capability will be declared when the all vehicles have been upgraded to Final Acceptance Build Standard.

Three Trojans (at Batch 5 standard) were deployed to Afghanistan in January 2010 in support of Operation Moshtarak.

## A.4. Capability Risks

There is a requirement to procure a complementary pair of Armoured Engineer vehicles to provide effective close mobility, counter-mobility and survivability support to current and future armoured and armoured infantry ground manoeuvre formations. Trojan and Titan have replaced their Chieftainbased predecessors that could not keep up with other armoured assets that are 2 generations younger. The Chieftain platforms were unreliable, difficult to support and restricted the tempo of armoured operations. In order to introduce timely capability, the Trojans and Titans have been procured in 5 batches with reliability growth trials conducted on each batch prior to the batch entering service. Trojan and Titan are key components of a coherent ground manoeuvre capability.

Assumptions.

• Support costs only include the main equipment support contracts’
costs. The support costs from the other non-equipment lines of development (training, people etc) have not been included.
• Several of these contracts are for the common Challenger items;
which are also found on Challenger 2 and Challenger Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle. The Trojan &amp; Titan costs have been calculated using actual and forecast track mileage; the overall contract costs have been apportioned accordingly. 2 Although an estimate of Whole Life Costs of £1051m was included in the Main Gate Business Case, no formal approval was made in respect of in-service support costs.<a href="fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></li>
