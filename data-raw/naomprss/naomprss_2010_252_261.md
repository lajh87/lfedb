<td>Some limitations relating to Global and Beyond Line of Sight communications. Overall, current perceived operational limitations associated with this Key Performance Measure reflect the absence of suitable Communication Information System to which the Sentinel System was designed, built and has demonstrated interoperability. The system needs time to readapt to the changed environment, which it is doing through both Urgent Operational Requirement and core funded activity. Current limitations do not directly prevent dissemination activities; they only reduce efficiency and introduce delay.</td>

• Support Contract – Long Term Support Strategy Increment 1

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Bowman and Common Battlefield Application Toolset, Digitisation Battlespace Land

Infrastructure and Platform Battlefield Information System Application programme ( hereafter referred to as the programme) provides a secure tactical voice and data communications system for all three Services in support of land, littoral and air manoeuvre operations. It replaced the Clansman combat radio system and the Headquarters infrastructure element of the Ptarmigan trunk system. The programme comprises of a series of incremental upgrades.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

Bowman was first approved in 1988, when it was expected to have the equivalent of Main Gate in 1993 and In-Service Date in 1995. After Feasibility Stage 1 in 1993, contracts were placed with two competing consortia for Feasibility and Project Definition Stages. In 1996 the two competing consortia formed a joint venture company and were awarded contracts for further risk reduction work prior to Main Gate, then planned for November 2000.

In July 2000, in order to meet the requirement, the Department rejected the consortia bid and relaunched the competition which was won by General Dynamics UK Ltd in July 2001. The Equipment Approvals Committee gave Main Gate approval in August 2001. In September 2001 General Dynamics United Kingdom Ltd was awarded the Bowman Supply and Support contract as prime contractor, and conducted its own competition among sub-contractors.

## A.3. Progress

On the basis of Brigade scale operational field trials, Bowman achieved its In Service Date on 26

March 2004. In 2005, the first converted brigade deployed to Iraq on Operation Telic, with a core Bowman capability alongside its residual Clansman capability. During 2005/2006 both Operation Telic and Operation Herrick converted fully from Clansman to Bowman.

During 2005, a review of the programme provided the opportunity to better ensure that it would deliver a capability consistent with the MOD’s vision of achieving Network Enabled Capability. Upgrade “4F” which began in 2005, provided secure voice and limited data capability with conversion of over 13,000 vehicle platforms completed by November 2009. Upgrade “5” with improved data capability, has delivered capability which, following extensive user trialling, achieved Full Systems Acceptance on 2 April 2009 and is currently being fielded across Defence. Continued operational experience indicates that Bowman is delivering critical operational capability. The original Bowman contract in 2001 only provided for limited support, therefore until funding allowed a longer term support solution and to prevent loss of capability, a number of contracts were approved in 2006 to meet and sustain levels of support required for Operations. These contracts bridged the period up to April 2009, when the Approval for Stage 1 of a separate Longer Term Support solution came into effect (see Section
# A.7.1).

[^1]: The Key Requirements which were used for Pre In Service Date have now been replaced by Key User Requirements due to the programme being post In Service Date
