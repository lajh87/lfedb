# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

The Typhoon Future Capability Programme will provide enhancements to the Typhoon aircraft, both in the air-to-air and air-to-surface roles, to sustain the Royal Air Force’s Typhoon fleet’s multi-role capabilities.

The Typhoon aircraft commenced operational duties in June 2007 with an advanced air-to-air missile capability. A contract was placed in July 2006 for an initial precision air-to-surface capability on Royal Air Force Tranche 1 Typhoon which will be implemented by mid-2008. This initial capability will be complemented by a more comprehensive air-to-surface package which is contained within the first phase of the Future Capability Programme, under a contract signed in March 2007.

The first phase of the Future Capability Programme will integrate Paveway IV and the Litening III Laser Designator Pod onto Tranche 2 aircraft from 2012 as well as interoperability upgrades without which those aircraft will be neither compliant with new civil airspace regulations nor interoperable with key coalition allies. It will also provide the Human Machine Interface for Multi-Role operations, allowing Typhoon to fulfil air-to-air and air-to-surface operations with the current, planned and projected weapons.

Subsequent phases of the Future Capability Programme are under consideration in parallel with negotiations on the third Tranche purchase of Typhoon.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The approval process for Typhoon Tranche 2 noted the intention to develop the capability of the aircraft through life and envisaged an incremental route to the acquisition of future capability enhancements beyond Full Operational Clearance (Minimum). The assessment phase found technology and integration were not a major challenge and that risks mostly pertained to the commercial and industrial aspects of the programme. These have been addressed and the MoD approvals process for the project was accelerated to combine Initial Gate, including the cost already incurred during the Assessment Phase, and Main Gate in order to maximise efficiency across the four Partner Nations.

## 5b. Cost of the Assessment Phase

| £m (outturn prices)       | Assessment Phase cost | Proportion of total estimated procurement expenditure |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Actual Cost                   | 44                        | 9%                                                        |
| Approved Cost at Initial Gate | 44                        | 9%                                                        |
| Variation                     | 0                         |                                                           |
