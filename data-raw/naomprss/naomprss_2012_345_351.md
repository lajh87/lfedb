# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1 The Requirement

Cipher will provide protection for all of MOD’s sensitive information and communications both at home and overseas. The project encapsulates work to renew the MOD cryptographic inventory and key management systems. Cipher will replace a number of current systems, in particular the General Key Management System.

There are three business drivers for Cipher. The first is to overcome the obsolescence of existing equipment and key management systems. The second is to enable network agility and interoperability with our Allies. The final driver is to improve security and efficiency in the delivery of cryptographic services.

Cipher will be delivered in three increments. Increment 1 provides an Enduring Operational Capability, Increment 2 replaces all legacy services and Increment 3 providing the additional services required to satisfy new requirements.

The MOD uses three levels of technology maturity metrics. These are:

1.  Technology Readiness Levels to describe the levels of maturity that are embodied in systems.

2.  System Readiness Levels for the integrated systems.

3.  Information Readiness Levels which provide a meaningful measurement of the maturity of the information design.

Cipher is a large, complex information-centric programme, involving Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) and therefore Information Readiness Levels have been selected to report against for this project.

## A.2 Assessment Phase History

Cipher is a combination of two earlier MOD projects, the Future Crypto Programme (Delivering the hardware) and Interoperable Electronic Key Distribution (the complementary system to deliver keying material, and other supporting configuration and management data). The Initial Gate approval, issued in August 2007, for a combined assessment phase for the two programmes authorised an assessment phase funding of \\\ at 50% confidence with agreement that the funding could be increased to
\\\ at 75% confidence subject to written confirmation from Head of Capability that the additional funding was available. No delivery phase timescale or funding estimate was provided in the Initial Gate submission beyond the available ten year funding profile. However, an Information Note issued in December 2008 stated 2012 as the date for the Initial Operating Capability.

Following Initial Gate approval, two consortia were down-selected and awarded “Assessment Phase" contracts in November 2008 to evaluate potential options, develop solutions, undertake demonstration programmes and deliver costed delivery phase proposals. The competition was undertaken in accordance with the Initial Gate strategy and the Procurement Strategy and both consortia agreed to at least match MOD funding for their assessment phase programmes of work.

Recognising the importance of Cipher and its potential use across Government, the Government Communication Headquarters has engaged proactively, providing guidance on standards to ensure that the resulting solutions and services can be readily adopted by Other Government Departments and Partners Across Government and be interoperable with our Allies.

In June 2010, the Defence Equipment and Support Performance Delivery Improvement Team issued a report on Cipher. Head of Capability responded by producing a Project Mandate defining the project vision, scope, outcomes, delivery timelines and Governance arrangements. An Information Note was submitted to the Investment Appraisal Board in January 2011 to notify of the changes necessary, with a review of progress being held in February 2011 at a 2-Star Foundation Milestone Review. A Review Note was submitted to the Investment Approval Board in April 2011 seeking approval for the revised project timescales, the adoption of an incremental acquisition strategy and a revision to the approved budgetary level for the assessment phase of \\\
representing an uplift of \\\ to the Initial Gate approval at 50%
confidence. The programme includes four key mitigation actions of a) maturing the incremental approach, b) enhancing the delivery team with additional MOD and Government Communications Headquarters staff, c) developing a detailed and resourced plan and d) improving stakeholder and benefits management. Of these, a, c and d have progressed well. This left mitigation action falling short

## A.3 In-Year Progress

The Review Note outcome noted in A.2 resulted in contract amendments for both companies, increased spend for the extant project team (including Specialist Technical Support and Government

Communication Headquarters staff) by virtue of the longer time frame and a proportion for Risk Reduction activities.

The outcome of the February 2011 Foundation Milestone Review was to proceed, but with the direction that all outstanding actions from the Performance Delivery Improvement Treatment Phase would be addressed. The additional funding required for the delivery of the extended Assessment Phase was identified and revised staffing levels agreed. Funding was used to extend the contracts of Logica and Thales.

Cipher has continued to proceed with the successful completion of the tender evaluation process in February 2012. The public announcement of the preferred bidder has been delayed (pending resolution of a number of significant commercially sensitive issues). As at March 2012, the intent remained to submit the Main Gate Business Case for Increment 1 to Investment Approvals Committee in September 2012. However in late 2011, Defence Equipment and Support 3 Star lead for Cipher queried the maturity of the National Level 2 Design and Deliverability. As a result, a detailed review of the Procurement Strategy will precede the Main Gate decision. Representation from the preferred bidder has now joined the Project Team in Corsham. There is close joint working with both MOD and Government Communication Headquarters personnel and good progress is being made.

The next phase of the project is completion of the National Level 2 design (a more detailed design which is needed to complete the Service Requirement Document) which is being managed and delivered using

Government Communication Headquarter ‘best practice’ System Engineering methodology and process. A number of Planning Round 2012 options to re-align finances have impacted the project which collectively will extend the transition period, delay the realisation of benefits and extend the life of the project (but overall affordability has improved as a result). As reflected in the recently completed Office of Government Commerce Level 3 Review (Investment Decision), the availability of sufficient Suitably Qualified Experienced Personnel in project manpower (Crown Servants) is now a serious issue (AMBER/RED), and there are well known weaknesses in external governance and senior stakeholder support that are being addressed. A coherent and appropriately resourced joint Crypto Modernisation Programme to coordinate and span MOD, Government Communication Headquarters and Other

Government Departments (as applicable) activities in this area is now urgently required. The Office of

Government Commerce Gateway Level 3 Review again highlighted the high levels of technical risk inherent in the current approach (i.e. to proceed to Main Gate in advance of completion of the Level 2 design).

## A.4 Capability Risks

Capability risks if Cipher is delayed:

Existing Crypto capability lacks the flexibility to deliver Network Enabled Capability.

Efficiency savings related to automation of crypto capability are delayed leading to increased demand on service manpower.

The Cipher Intergrated Logistic Support strategy aims to provide a robust and 'fit for purpose' solution and assured adherence to the Support Solution. It will articulate the support framework that will be required for Cipher, bringing together the major elements of support, including the potential Contractor Logistic Support arrangements, the Support Solution Envelope and the role of the crypto System Operating Authority plus Networks Crypto Services for Defence. The Plan will be developed through progressive discussion with the major Intergrated Logistic Support stakeholders, including the Preferred Bidder.
