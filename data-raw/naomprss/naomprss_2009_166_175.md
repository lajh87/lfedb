• Post Main Investment Decision - Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is Planned to Replace the Air-to-Air Refuelling and the Passenger Air Transport Capability Currently Provided by the Royal Air Force’s Fleet of VC10 and TriStar Aircraft. Air-toAir Refuelling is a Key Military Capability that Significantly Increases the Operational Range and Endurance of Front Line Aircraft Across a Range of Defence Roles and Military Tasks.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Was Nominated as a Potential Private Finance Initiative Project in 1997. an Assessment Phase, to Confirm Whether PFI Would Offer Best Value for Money, Was Launched Following Initial Gate Approval in December 2000.

The Assessment Phase Confirmed Industry’s Ability to Meet the Service Requirement, Programme Timescales and Costs and Determined that the Inclusion of Passenger Air Transport Capability in the Contract will Represent Value for Money. It also Clarified the Manning and Personnel Implications.

Ministers Announced on 6 June 2007 that it Had Been Decided to Proceed Towards Financial and Contractual Close on the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft PFI which Was Achieved on 27 March 2008.

## A.3. Progress

The Main Gate Business Case Was Submitted to the Investment Approval Board in January 2007 and Was Approved in May 2007.

On 27 March 2008 a 27 Year PFI Contract Was Signed. the Investment Approval Board Approved Contract not to Exceed Cost Remains at £10.5bn. in Addition There will be Front Line Command Manpower and Support Costs.

The Final Approval Envelope for Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Was Set by the Investment Approval Board on 23 June 2008.

The Main Operating Base will be at RAF at Brize Norton and the Site Preparation Was Completed on Time. This Work Had to be Completed Before Construction of the New Facilities Could Commence and Was a Key Milestone for AirTanker Ltd’s Progress. the Infrastructure Work is on Track. the First Set of Wings Was Rolled Out in February 2009 at Broughton on Time.

Future Key Events Include: a Successful Critical Design Review Planned for the Air-to-Air Refuelling/Air Transport Aircraft in May 2009; the First A330-200 Aircraft is to be Despatched to EADS Madrid from Airbus in Toulouse in July 2009; and the Delivery of the First Aircraft into Service is Expected in 2011.

A New Requirement to Provide Additional Protection Against Hostile Action (Theatre Entry Standard) is Being Investigated and will Result in an Increased Cost if Adopted.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Air-to-Air Refuelling Assets will be Required to Extend the Range and Reach of many of the UK’s Frontline Fast Jet Fleets by Refuelling Them on Route to an Operational Theatre. Without Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft, a Significant Gap will Appear in the UK’s Strategic Deployment and Tactical Strike Capabilities. the Primary Role for the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft will be Air-to-Air Refuelling and the Objective of These Operations is to Enhance the Combat Effectiveness by Extending the Range, Payload or Endurance of Receiver Aircraft where and when it is Most Needed. Strategic Air Refuelling Supports the Deployment of Forces to Theatre Whilst Tactical or Theatre Air Refuelling Provides Mission Support to Units Active in an Operational Theatre.

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is Planned to Replace the Air-to-Air Refuelling Capability and Passenger Air Transport Capability Provided by the RAF’s VC10 and Tri Star Fleets.

The VC10 First Entered Service in the 1960s and Were Converted to Air-to-Air Refuelling Tankers at Various Dates Between 1980 and 1996. the Aircraft Has Ageing and Outdated Technology, and the Risks to Maintaining Reliability and Value for Money Grow and Ultimately it will not be Possible to Sustain the Capability. the TriStars First Entered Airline Service in the Early 1970s and Converted to their Current Tanker and Tanker/Freight Roles Between 1983 and 1987. These Aircraft are not Considered to be Supportable Beyond the Middle of the Next Decade.
