# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Programme will Provide Afloat Logistic Support to UK and Allied Maritime Task Groups at Sea and their Amphibious Components Operating Ashore. Although not Strictly a One-for-One Replacement Programme, New Vessels will Incrementally Replace Much of the Existing Royal Fleet Auxiliary Flotilla.

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Capability is Designed to Support Three Distinct Types of Maritime Task Group: Carrier Strike, Littoral Manoeuvre and Maritime Security. the Demands of Each Differ Significantly, but are all Composed of Three Common Elements:

Bulk Consumables - Fuel and Potable Water which are Transferred by Hose.

Non-Bulk Consumables - Food, Ammunition and General Stores. Solid Cargo which is Transferred in Unit Loads, Either Ship to Ship or Ship to Shore.

Forward Aviation Support - The Provision of Helicopter Basing and Operating Facilities to Accommodate some of the Task Group’s Aircraft or to Provide Operational Flexibility During a Campaign.

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Capability will be in Service into the 2050s and will be Designed to Accommodate the Requirements of Current and Known Future Force Structures, Including Type 45, the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carriers, Joint Combat Aircraft and Type 26 Global Combat Ship.

Tankers will Provide Bulk Consumables and Forward Aviation Support to the Maritime Task Group. Solid Support Ships, Previously Referred to as Fleet Solid Support and Amphibious Combat Stores Ship, will Provide Non Bulk Consumables and Forward Aviation Support to the Maritime Task Group.

The Capability to be Provided is Essential to the Evolving Logistic Support Needs of the Royal Navy. the Proposed Procurement Profile of Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Ships Has Been Matched to this

Need with Initial Focus on the Double-Hulled Tankers which are Required in Order to Comply with International Maritime Legislation.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Programme Received Formal Approval to Enter Its Assessment

Phase in July 2005 Based on an Alliance Strategy. Following a Review of the Procurement Strategy in 2007, the Alliance Strategy Was Terminated. a New Strategy, Based on a ‘competitive and Adaptive’ Approach, Was Approved and Reflected the Need to Procure the Tanker Element of the Programme Separately in Order to Comply with International Maritime Legislation. in Addition Approval Was Granted for the Designation and Delegation of the Heavy Replenishment at Sea Project as a Separate Category D Project. Solid Support Ships will Now Form a Separate Strategy. an Open International Competition Was Launched for the Design and Build of Up to Six Fleet Tankers but Was Cancelled Following the Department's Examination of Its Equipment Programme in 2008. a Review of the Requirements and Procurement Strategy Was Undertaken which Concluded that a more Open Procurement Strategy to Consider a Range of Possible Solutions and which Take Account of the Market Conditions Was more Likely to Secure Best Value for Money for the MOD. a New International Competition for Up to Six Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Tankers Was Launched in October 2009 which Was Conducted using the Competitive Dialogue Process.

Subsequently the Requirement Was Reduced from Six Ships to Four as a Result of the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010.

Following Assessment of Initial Pre Qualification Questionnaires Six Companies Were Invited to Proceed to the Next Stage of the Competition. the Competition Was Conducted over Three Stages: Stage 1 - Invitation to Submit Outline Solutions Took Place over March to September 2010; Stage 2 - Invitation to Submit Detailed Solutions Commenced in October 2010 and Continued Through to Invitation to Submit Final Bids in October 2011 which Was Issued to Three Companies; Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering

(Republic of Korea), Fincantieri (Italy), Hyundai Heavy Industries (Republic of Korea). Three Companies Withdrew Earlier in the Competition; Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft (Germany); Knutsen OAS Ltd in June 2011 and A&P Group Ltd in August 2011.

The Current Approved Budget for the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Assessment Phase is £44m and the Current Forecast for the Assessment Phase £17m. Following the Department’s Annual Planning Round 2012 the Fleet Solid Support Element of the Programme Was Considered a Non Core Equipment Programme and will Require Departmental Review Before Further Work is Undertaken and Therefore No Further Forecast Assessment Phase Expenditure is Included. the Tanker Element of the Programme Passed Through Main Gate in 2011.

## A.3. Project History

The Main Gate Business Case for the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Tankers Was Approved by the Investment Approvals Committee in October 2011. the Performance Cost and Time Envelope Put Forward at that Time Was Based on Available Indicative Information the Approval of which Enabled the Department to Proceed to the Final Bid Stage of the Competition. Further Departmental and HM Treasury Approval to Proceed to Contract Award Was Received in January 2012 and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Was Named as the Preferred Bidder in February 2012. the Contract Was Placed in March 2012.

In Accordance with the Department's Approvals Process the Final Performance Cost and Time Was Approved in December 2012 Providing the Project's Baseline. in June 2012 Her Majesty the Queen Approved the Names of the Tankers Confirmed to be RFA TIDESPRING, RFA TIDERACE, RFA

TIDESURGE, RFA TIDEFORCE. the Preliminary Design Review Was Completed in July 2012.

## A.4. in-Year Progress

Completion of Design Transition from Basic Design Phase to Detailed Design Phase in June 2013. Award and Commencement of Build Oversight and Surveillance Contract to SeaQuest Marine Project

Management Ltd in August 2013. Before Entering Service the Ships will Require Customisation in the UK and will Undergo Further Trials; an Advert Was Placed in the Defence Contracts Bulletin for the UK Customisation, Capability Assessment Trials and Support Contract in December 2013.

## A.5. Capability Risks

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Programme will Deliver Future Royal Fleet Auxiliary Ships, Replacing the Current Capability, to Support the Future Royal Navy. Without the Support of These Ships, the Ability of the Royal Navy to Carry Out Global Operations will be Severely Restricted. Double Hulled Naval Tankers are Required as Soon as is Practicable to Comply with International Maritime Legislation; the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Currently Operates Two Double Hulled Tankers and Four Single Hulled Tankers under Exemption from Legislation. the Number of Ships with Single Hulled Tanks Was Reduced from Six to Four in 2011 as a Result of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. All Royal Fleet Auxiliary Ships are Maintained to UK Regulatory and Classifications Standards; Should this Certification and Classification be Withdrawn for Single Hulled Tankers, their Operation Would Cease Immediately Leading to Severe Operational Limitations on the Ability of the Royal Navy to Operate Worldwide and in Anything but the Most Benign Environments. Foreign Nations Have Already Begun to Deny Port Access for Single Hulled Tankers and this Situation will be Exacerbated as a Consequence of any Environmental Incident, MOD Shipping Related or Not. Programming for Operations Takes Account of Environmental Restrictions as Well as Limitations on Ships Due to their Material State; for Example some of the Older Ships are Unable to Operate in Colder Climates Due to the Steel in their Ageing Hulls Becoming Brittle. These Ships will be Replaced as the Double Hulled Tanker Element of the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Programme is Delivered.
