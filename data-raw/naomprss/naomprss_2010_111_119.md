• Post Main Investment Decision – Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Service is Planned to Replace the Air-to-Air Refuelling and the Passenger Air Transport Capability Currently Provided by the Royal Air Force’s Fleet of VC10 and TriStar Aircraft. Air-to-Air Refuelling is a Key Military Capability that Significantly Increases the Operational Range and Endurance of Front Line Aircraft Across a Range of Defence Roles and Military Tasks.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Was Nominated as a Potential Private Finance Initiative Project in 1997. an Assessment Phase, Designed to Confirm Whether PFI Would Offer Best Value for Money, Was Launched Following Initial Gate Approval in December 2000.

The Assessment Phase Confirmed Industry’s Ability to Meet the Service Requirement, Programme Timescales and Costs and Determined that the Inclusion of Passenger Air Transport Capability in the Contract Would Represent Value for Money. It also Clarified the Manning and Personnel Implications.

## A.3. Progress

The Main Gate Business Case Was Submitted to the Investment Approval Board in January 2007 and Was Approved in May 2007. in March 2008 a 27 Year PFI Contract Was Signed.

The Final Approval Envelope for Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Was Set by the Investment Approval Board in June 2008.

The Investment Approval Board Approved Contract not to Exceed Cost Remains at £10.5bn. in Addition There will be Front Line Command Manpower and Support Costs Leading to a Total Cost of £12.7bn.

The Main Operating Base will be Located at RAF Brize Norton and the Site Preparation Has Been Completed on Time. This Work Had to be Completed Before Construction of the New Infrastructure Could Commence and Was a Key Milestone for AirTanker Ltd’s Progress. the Infrastructure Work is on Track.

The First Set of Wings Was Rolled Out on Time in February 2009 at Broughton. the First A330-200 Aircraft Successfully Completed Its Maiden Flight in June 2009 and Was Delivered to the Airbus Military Facility at Getafe, Spain in July 2009; the Second Aircraft Joined it in September 2009. Both Aircraft are Currently Being Converted for their FSTA Role;
Work is Progressing to Plan and Test Flying is Due to Commence in September 2010.

An Aircraft Test Readiness Review is Scheduled for May 2010. the Delivery of the First Aircraft into Service is Expected in October 2011.

A Technical Feasibility Study into Aircraft Self Protection Measures Has Been Produced by AirTanker, and the Outcome is Being Considered. if this Option is Exercised it will Result in Additional Cost.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) Programme will Provide the Royal Air Force (RAF) with a Reliable, Safe and Efficient Air to Air Refuelling and Air Transport, Service for 24 Years.

Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Air-to-Air Refuelling Aircraft will be Required to Extend the Range and Reach of many of the UK’s Frontline Fast Jet Fleets by Refuelling Them on Route to an Operational Theatre. Without Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft, a Significant Gap will Appear in the UK’s Strategic Deployment and Tactical Strike Capabilities. the Primary Role for the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft will be Air-to-Air Refuelling and the Objective of These Operations is to Enhance the Combat Effectiveness by Extending the Range, Payload or Endurance of Receiver Aircraft where and when it is Most Needed. Strategic Air Refuelling Supports the Deployment of Forces to Theatre Whilst Tactical or Theatre Air Refuelling Provides Mission Support to Units Active in an Operational Theatre.

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is Planned to Replace the Air-to-Air Refuelling Capability and Passenger Air Transport Capability Provided by the RAFs VC10 and TriStar Fleets.

The First Civilian VC10 Entered Service in the 1960s and These Were Converted to Air-to-Air Refuelling Tankers at Various Dates Between 1980 and 1996. the Aircraft Has Ageing and Outdated Technology, and the Risks to Maintaining Reliability and Value for Money Have Grown and Ultimately it will not be Possible to Sustain Capability. the TriStars First Entered Airline Service in the Early 1970s and Converted to their Current Tanker and Tanker/Freight Roles Between 1983 and 1987. These Aircraft are not Considered to be Supportable Beyond the Middle of the Next Decade.
