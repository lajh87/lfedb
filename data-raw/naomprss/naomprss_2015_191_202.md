# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Service will provide the Air-to-Air Refuelling and the passenger Air

Transport capability previously provided by the Royal Air Force’s fleet of VC10 and TriStar aircraft. Air-toAir Refuelling is a key military capability that significantly increases the operational range and endurance of front line aircraft across a range of Defence roles and military tasks.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft was nominated as a potential Private Finance Initiative project in 1997. An Assessment Phase, designed to confirm whether a Private Finance Initiative would offer best value for money, was launched following Initial Gate approval in December 2000.

The Assessment Phase confirmed industry’s ability to meet the service requirement, programme timescales and costs and determined that the inclusion of passenger Air Transport capability in the contract would represent value for money. It also clarified the manning and personnel implications.

## A.3. Project History

The Main Gate Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in January 2007 and was approved in May 2007. In March 2008 a 27 year Private Finance Initiative contract was signed. The final Approval envelope for Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft was set by the Investment Approvals Board in June 2008.

The Investment Approvals Board approved Contract Not To Exceed cost remains at £10.5 Bn. In addition there will be Front Line Command manpower and support costs leading to a total cost of £12.3 Bn.

The successful maiden flight of the first green Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft A330-200 aircraft took place on the 4th June 2009; the aircraft was subsequently delivered for conversion to the Airbus Military purpose-built hangar facility Getafé in Spain on the 10th July 2009. It was joined by the second Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft aircraft on the 7th September 2009; both aircraft have now been converted for their Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft role, which includes fitting of military avionics as well as the specialist refuelling equipment. Following this work both aircraft moved into the Certification and Qualification programme.

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is not simply about the procurement of aircraft, but covers all aspects of an integrated worldwide aircraft service, ranging from the provision of the infrastructure, including a hangar complex (which allows for the maintenance of two aircraft simultaneously and houses the two Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Squadrons, the maintenance crew; operations centre and associated office accommodation), a full flight crew and engineer training service, despatch and ground support. The new facility, known as the AirTanker Hub, was completed ahead of schedule and was officially opened on 31 March 2011, for the provision of the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft service at Royal Air Force Brize Norton.

The construction of the training facility building was completed ahead of schedule.

TEMPEST and Defensive Aids Sub System testing began at Boscombe Down on 18 April 2011 and Ground testing for Air to Air Refuelling with receivers began in May 2011.

European Aviation Safety Agency issued the Supplemental Type Certificate 1 and 2 to Airbus Military on 20 April 2011 and 29 July 2011 respectively. MOD and Air Tanker signed a contract on 11 July 2011 to allow C130 Hercules aircraft to use the hangar for line maintenance.

Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox named the Future Strategic Transport Aircraft ‘Voyager’ at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Royal Air Force Fairford on 15 July 2011.

Cobham achieved the UK Civil Aviation Authority approval for the extension to their European Aviation Safety Agency Part-145 accreditation, to include Base and Line Maintenance for the Airbus A330-243 series aircraft on 23 August 2011, signifying the beginning of the conversion programme at Cobham.

<th>On the 10 October 2011 the Civil Aviation Authority issued the Part 145 &amp; M Certificate to Air Tanker Services. This completed the set of Air Tanker Services deliverables for Introduction to Service. Because of problems in the trials programme and delay in delivery of documentation from Air Tanker, the Introduction To Service date slipped to February 2012. The first Voyager aircraft arrived at Royal Air Force Brize Norton on 21 December 2011. On arrival, Air Tanker registered the aircraft and obtained the Civil Aviation Authority Certificate of Airworthiness. The originally planned flight trials to clear wing pod Air to Air Refuelling for Tornado and Typhoon finished in December 2011. These trials identified problems associated with fuel leakage at various parts of the Air to Air Refuelling clearance flight envelope. Rectification plans for these issues were agreed with Air Tanker and the Independent Technical Adviser on 31 January 2012. The Simulator Test Readiness Review completed successfully on 10 January 2012. The Type Certification Exposition version 5 for Air Transport &amp; Aeromed 3 was issued on 2 February 2012. Capability Acceptance at Introduction To Service acknowledged that only the Air Transport and Aeromed 3 elements of the capability had been achieved on 2 February 2012, but not achievement of an acceptable Air to Air Refuelling capability. The Director Air Support signed the Voyager Release To Service Recommendation for Air Transport and Aeromed 3 only, on 21 March 2012. Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project has previously been reported in the Major Projects Report on a forecasted Whole Life Cost basis, including all costs (up to 2035) for PFI contract and other costs incurred by MOD in use of the PFI service. Public Accounts Committee on 4 February 2013 agreed that fuel costs would be removed from future reports. MOD and NAO agreed for Major Projects Report 2013 that Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project should be reported on a basis similar to that of other projects. This resulted in a reduction in the approval value from £12,307 million, reported in 2012, to £11,779 million reported in MPR13. The fuel elements were also removed from the forecast cost and cost variations. FSTA continued to build capability. The 1st Voyager aircraft was in trials programme with Airbus Military. The 2nd aircraft (MOD’s 1st delivered) was granted a Release To Service for Air Transport on 4 April 2012, was placed on Military Aircraft Register on 5 Apr 2012 and commenced operational flying. Following experience on the 3rd and 4th aircraft conversions, industry decided in Jun 2012 to move remaining 10 conversions to Airbus Military facility in Getafe near Madrid. The 3rd aircraft was delivered end of December 2012, transferred to the Military Register and commenced Air Transport tasking. A standard (un-converted) Airbus A330 has been used since 5 January 2013 by AirTanker Services. This
“green” aircraft has alleviated pressure on AAR crew training during 2013 through being used for Air Transport operations instead of other Voyager aircraft. It will be fed back into the conversion programme in January 2015. MOD placed on contract the enhanced FSTA Aircraft Platform Protection system (EDAS). Embodiment is underway, as planned in the programme and is also reflected in wider defence capability planning. Voyager infrastructure at RAF Brize Norton completed, also the training service stood up with the full flight simulator operational and used to train crews. The 4th Voyager aircraft was delivered on time at the end of April 2013. The remaining deliveries remained on schedule and the May 2014 ISD remained unchanged. Aircraft deliveries continued during 2013/14 with a total of seven aircraft (including the above reported “green” aircraft) delivered at the end of March 2014. During 2013/14 the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project continued to build operational capability. The Release To Service clearance to deliver Air to Air Refuelling of Tornado was granted on 16 May 2013. The Typhoon Release To Service and Mk3 Voyager Release To Service for 2 point tanking were both granted on 15 August 2013. The Release To Service for refuelling C130 aircraft from the Fuselage Refuelling Unit was granted in March 2014 and the Release To Services’ of Extended Twin Range Operations for Air Transport and Air To Air Refuelling were granted in February and March 14 respectively. With the granting of the Release To Service’s, Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is now delivering the capability requirements of Air Transport, Air to Air Refuelling, and Medevac capabilities. The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft stepped up its operational delivery when it took over the Falkland Islands South Atlantic Airbridge in October 2013 from expensive charter aircraft. Following accelerated delivery (three months earlier than planned) of the enhanced Aircraft Platform Protection system capability previously reported, it took over the Afghanistan airbridge from Tristar aircraft in December 2013. During the 2013 calendar year, the Voyager aircraft flew 7,404 hours in RAF service.</th>

## A.4. In-Year Progress

FSTA has continued to deliver exemplary Air- to-Air Refuelling (AAR) and Air Transport (AT) capabilities.

With a number of Operational Emergency Clearances for overseas aircraft Voyager has provided Air-to-

Air Refuelling to UK and coalition aircraft involved in operations against the Islamic State since August 2014. At the end of the reporting period Voyager had provided in excess of 8 million litres in operations and had broken a number of UK AAR records.

The 7^th^ modified aircraft was delivered during May 2014 and the 8^th^
modified aircraft was being prepared for RAF usage following accelerated implementation of the Enhanced Platform Protection modification. As all critical military capabilities required to meet the current operational demand had been delivered the aircraft was deemed ready to enter service in May 2014. All modified Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft in the fleet are capable of refuelling operations simultaneously with any two of Air-to-Air Refuelling probe- equipped Fast Jets and, as specified, five aircraft are equipped to transfer fuel to large aircraft. The previously reported ‘green’ unmodified aircraft is now in conversion and will be delivered in Oct.2015.

## A.5. Capability Risks

Following the retirement of the VC10 and Tristar aircraft, the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft programme provides to the Royal Air Force a reliable, safe and efficient Military Air Transport and Air to Air Refuelling service.

The primary role for the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is Air-to-Air Refuelling, and the objective of these operations is to enhance combat effectiveness by extending the range, payload or endurance, of front line fast jet aircraft and large aircraft types where and when it is needed. Continued availability of FSTA aircraft and operational clearances is essential to maintain the UK's strategic deployment and tactical strike capabilities.
