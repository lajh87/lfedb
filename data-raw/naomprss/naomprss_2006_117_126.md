# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Support Vehicle Programme will Procure the Future Tri-Service Cargo and Recovery Vehicles that will Increase and Sustain the Military’s Materiel Lift, Distribution, and Recovery Capabilities. These Vehicles will Replace the in-Service Cargo and Recovery Vehicles Providing Improved Mobility, Crew

Protection, Load Carrying Capability & Compliance with Current &
Foreseeable United Kingdom/European Union Vehicle Legislation.

The Project Passed Main Gate in November 2001 which Approved an International Competitive Conventional Procurement in Place of an Aborted PFI, by-Passing the Assessment Phase and Moving Directly to the Main Investment Decision. MAN ERF UK Ltd Was Declared Preferred Bidder in October 2004.

The Investments Approvals Board Directed the Project Team to Procure the Minimum Contracted Number of Vehicles (5165) and Conduct an Investment Appraisal to Establish Whether Retaining Elements of the Existing Fleet to 2034 Offers Better Value for Money than Procuring the Additional 2077 Cargo Vehicles. the Investment Appraisal Confirmed that Procuring New Vehicles Offers Better Value for Money. Investments Appraisals Board Approval to Procure Up to 2077 Additional Vehicles Was Given in April 2006.

A Contract Was Let with MAN ERF UK Ltd on 31 March 2005 to Provide 5,165 Vehicles: 4,851 Cargo, 314 Recovery and 69 Recovery Trailers. the First 6, 9 & 15 Tonne Vehicle Prototypes Have Now Been Produced and are Undergoing Contractor Tests and Trials Before Commencing Authority Testing. a Departmental Review, which Commenced November 2005 and Aimed at Further Reducing Cost and Understanding Risk, Resulted in a Comprehensive Revisit of the Requirement which Has Resulted in a Reduction in the Number of Recovery Vehicles and Other Peripherals.

An in-Service Date (ISD) of February 2008 is Being Reported. However the ISD is in 2 Stages – 161 Cargo Vehicles in July 2007 and 8 Recovery Vehicles Plus 2 Recovery Trailers in February 2008.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

There Was No Assessment Phase. the SV Programme Had Its Origin as the Future Cargo Vehicles

(FCV) and the Future Wheeled Recovery Vehicle (FWRV) Projects. These Were Launched as Potential Private Finance Initiative (PFI) Programmes with Advertisements in August 1998 and September 1999 Respectively. the FCV Project Progressed Through Pre-Qualification and Outline Proposal Stages with Five Bidders Short-Listed. an Initial Gate Business Case Was Drafted in December 1999, but Was not Submitted for Approval Because it Did not Demonstrate Value for Money.

Further Work Was Requested to Identify Areas for Further Innovation, and also to Develop a ‘smart’ Public Sector Comparator (PSC). Work Continued to Produce a more Robust Case but it Became Clear that Confidence in PFI Procurement Was Unlikely to Improve. the Decision Was Taken in March 2001 to Replace the PFI Procurement Strategy with a Conventional Strategy and Hold a Fresh Competition. Furthermore the FCV and FWRV Programmes Were Merged into a Single Procurement and Proceeded Directly to the Main Investment Decision which Was Secured in November 2001. the Project Bypassed the Assessment Phase Because it Was Concluded that the Technologies Were Mature and as the Department Had, During the PFI Phase of the Project, Acquired a Detailed Knowledge of the Commercial Vehicle Sector, the Risks Were Low. It Was also Necessary to Avoid Further Delays in Order to Maintain Industrial Interest in the Requirement. the Time and Cost Boundaries Were Set at Main Gate and Following an Advertisement Placed in the MOD Contracts Bulletin, a Short-List of Six Prime Contractors Was Drawn Up.
