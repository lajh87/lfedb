POST MAIN GATE PROJECT SUMMARY SHEET

SOOTHSAYER

Integrated Project Team Responsible: JOINT ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE (JES)

Single Point of Accountability for project capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Intelligence, Surveillance Target Acquisition & Reconnaissance)

Senior Responsible Owner for broader capability:

Capability Manager (Information Systems)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

The SOOTHSAYER integrated Land Electronic Warfare (EW) system will provide the Land

Commander with a 24 hour, all weather source of intelligence, through its Communications and Non Communications Electronic Support Measures (CESM and NCESM) capability. The system detects, locates and identifies radio and radar signals. In addition, SOOTHSAYER will provide an integrated Communications Electronic Counter Measures (CECM) system. SOOTHSAYER replaces a number of systems including Odette and the Interim Non-Communications Equipment (INCE).

Following a competitive Assessment Phase, a Demonstration and Manufacture contract was placed with Lockheed Martin (Owego USA) in August 2003. SOOTHSAYER will be delivered in three main phases. The first phase, which includes CESM and interim CECM, is expected to be delivered to the Royal Marines in February 2008 (In Service Date
\[ISD\]). The second Capability Phase is planned for delivery to Land in December 2008. Under both phases the system will be fitted to the MEONIC (previously MYSTIC or the Light Role SUPACAT High Mobility Transport (HMT) 6\6) soft skin vehicle. The third phase, assuming an Equipment Planning (EP) Round 2007 realism option has been taken, will provide an armoured CESM and NCESM capability to Land in December 2013.

Delay in the development and delivery of the MEONIC vehicle resulted in a slip to the ISD and an increase in procurement costs being declared in January 2005. Vehicle reliability issues have been addressed and first phase deliveries are now complete. However, technical issues with the development and testing of the CESM have led to the forecast ISD being further delayed.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Initial Gate business case for SOOTHSAYER was approved in August 1999. Following a competition, two prime contractors, Lockheed Martin and Thales Defence, were selected to provide a technical solution along with costs, risks and timescales for a Demonstration and Manufacture phase. Originally, down-selection to one prime contractor was planned for the end of the Demonstration Phase. In April 2002, an extension to the Assessment Phase and further risk reduction work was approved, and agreement given to down-selection at Main Gate Approval.
