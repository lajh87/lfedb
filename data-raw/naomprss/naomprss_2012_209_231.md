# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

The Lynx Wildcat capability was developed to meet the requirements for a dedicated small helicopter for use in both the Land (Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter Requirement) and Maritime (Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft Requirement) environments to replace the current Lynx fleet which is reaching its life end. Lynx Wildcat is a single-source, combined helicopter procurement programme with Westlands Helicopters Ltd which follows More Effective Contracting principles. Project approval is for 80 aircraft, with funding for 62 held by the Integrated Project Team. The current requirement is for 30 Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters, 8 Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters (Light Assault Helicopter Role) and 28 Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

<th>Initial Gate approval was given in December 2001 for the Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter and in September 2002 for the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft. Following review under the Future Rotorcraft Programme the Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter requirement matured into the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter requirement. Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter:
The Assessment Phase benchmarked Westland Helicopter Ltd's Lynx Wildcat proposal against alternative off-the-shelf solutions from other potential suppliers and required the company to demonstrate the necessary level of performance to successfully deliver the Demonstration and Manufacture phase. Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft:
A single tender contract was placed with Westland Helicopter Ltd to develop and de-risk their Lynx Wildcat proposal to meet the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft requirement in conjunction with the approved Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter programme. Procurement Strategy:
Two procurement strategies were considered. The first was to run a competition and second, to pursue the Westland Helicopter Lynx Wildcat proposal on a single tender basis - with an option to switch from single tender to competition should the Assessment Phase indicate that the Lynx Wildcat solution was unlikely to be cost effective. The second strategy was the selected one. The result of the Assessment Phase considered the Lynx Wildcat to be the most likely of the options to deliver the required capability by the In-service Date. This gave the benefit of maintaining industrial capability in the UK. Hence a single tender approach was judged most likely to offer both the best technical solution and best value for money overall. The Assessment Phase successfully de-risked a number of key requirements, including secure communications, mission systems and engine certification. Furthermore, Westland Helicopter Ltd's Super Lynx 300 export programme demonstrated their capability to insert new T-800 engines, glass cockpit and avionics into the Lynx aircraft.</th>

# A.3 Project History since Main Gate

Within the Department the aircraft are to be known as Wildcat Mk1 (Army Helicopter) and Wildcat Mk1 (Helicopter Maritime Attack).

The Demonstration & Manufacture contract was let in June 2006 to deliver 70 aircraft: 40 Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters for the Army and 30 Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft for the Navy with costed options for five more platforms of each type. Preliminary, Interim, Air Vehicle and Air Vehicle & Mission System Critical Design Reviews were successfully achieved in January 2007, October 2007,

April 2008 and August 2009 respectively. The first airframe was delivered to the Westland build line in November 2008 and a successful
'First Flight' was achieved in November 2009 in accordance with the schedule contracted in June 2006. All three trials aircraft are now flying within the Flight Test programme and Production aircraft build commenced in July 2010. Delivery of first production aircraft to the Army commences in April 2012. The Equipment Examination (2008) concluded that reductions could be realised in procurement costs if the quantities were reduced to 34 Reconnaissance Helicopters and 28 Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft, with the impact on delivered capability minimised through introducing design changes to achieve greater versatility between the two aircraft variants. The protracted period of uncertainty surrounding the project ended in December 2008 with the Ministerial announcement confirming that the project would proceed to full scale production. A Planning Round 2010 Option was run to address the legislative and safety requirement to fit all combat aircraft including helicopters with fuel system survivability measures.

Through-life training & support solutions have been developed as part of the project. An Information Note was approved in July 2007 to submit the Support Solution Review Note in September 2009. Approval was also given for the Training Service Initial Gate Business Case in August 2007 based on the 4-stage PFI Treasury Approval process. While investigating alternative ways to deliver the Lynx Wildcat capability during the Equipment Examination, the opportunity to deliver reduced through life costs was identified. A Review note was submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in December 2008 and approved in January 2009, detailing a new strategy to explore a single source, integrated Support Solution and Training Delivery Service through the aircraft manufacturer, AgustaWestland, and reflected a revised recommendation submission date to the Investment Approvals Board in late 2010. The contract for the provision of Training Capital Equipment, required to support aircrew, groundcrew and maintainer training was let in February 2011 and the Wildcat Integrated Training and Support contract was let in January 2012.

Planning Round 2011 Option resulted in a change of aircraft mix to a total fleet of 66 Wildcat Aircraft comprising 30 Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters, 8 Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters (Light Assault Helicopter Role) and 28 Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft. A further Planning Round 2011 Option was run to revise the profile of the resources available for the Wildcat project between financial year 2014/2015 and financial year 2015/2016.

<th>Production aircraft build continues to schedule with six Army Helicopter having achieved flight milestones with a further four Army Helicopter and two Helicopter Maritime Attack aircraft in production. The build standard for the first batch of production aircraft to be delivered to the Army has been confirmed and the Interim Certificate of Design was issued in March 2012. Significant unanticipated activity has been undertaken to satisfy the emerging Regulatory Instructions issued by the recently formed Military Aviation Authority (MAA). Following the issue of the Aircraft Release Recommendations by the Independent Technical Evaluator (Aircraft Test and Evaluation Centre (ATEC)) the Aircraft Release to Service Recommendations will be endorsed by Director Helicopters and forwarded to the MAA and the Army Release to Service Authority for approval in April 2012 to enable flight by Service personnel. A Planning Round 2012 Option is being run to address the incorporation of an Aircraft Collision Avoidance System to all combat helicopters including Wildcat. This is to be managed as a separate project. The Light Assault Helicopter Requirement is subject to ongoing work to inform the approval decision. If the Department concludes during the planning process in 2012/13 that the LAH capability is not part of the Core Programme then aircraft numbers and costs will be amended to reflect the existing requirement and this will be shown in MPR13. Under the contract amendment to the Future Lynx Demonstration &amp;
Manufacture contract, the Training Capital Equipment is being delivered by AgustaWestland through two sub-contractors: the Aircrew Training Equipment under subcontract to Indra (Madrid) is progressing to schedule, but a delay has recently been announced to the Maintenance Training Equipment subcontract with Pennant. The training building infrastructure is running to schedule. Following approval in December 2011, AgustaWestland were awarded the Wildcat Integrated Support and Training (WIST) contract on 26 January 2012 for Pricing Period 1 (to 31 March 2017) within the framework of a through-life, single source contracting arrangement with integral five yearly re-pricing and exit strategies. The contract provides the full range of Technical and Materiel Support Services, a Support Management Organisation and a Training Service. Following the establishment phase, it will 'go live' to support the first aircraft delivery from April 2012. Approval was also granted to contract the Logistic Enablers which includes the Initial Provisioning of spares and constitution of Deployable Spares Packs as well as funding for support activities outside of Wildcat Integrated Support and Training, such as obsolescence resolution and out of scope spares, required over the period. The Support and Training Key Performance Indicators will be reported on in MPR 13.</th>

# A.5 Capability Risks

These projects provide ongoing light helicopter capability in the land, maritime & littoral environments, beyond the Out of Service Dates of the current Lynx Helicopter fleet and introduce an enhanced maritime & littoral attack capability. The reduction in aircraft quantities arising from the Equipment Examination is predicated upon a more versatile design solution allowing both aircraft variants to be utilised across a wider range of roles and environments, but with some minor trade-off against the achieved performance. This will place a greater necessity on the need to manage the two variants within a common in-service framework with commonality within the Defence Lines of Development.

The April 2011 reduction of Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopters from 34 to 30 will reduce the capacity in which to meet the requirement for aviation Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Intelligence gathering in Land/Littoral Manoeuvre operations but remains sufficient to meet the defence requirement.

The main investment decision point for Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy), which is to be installed on the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft, was delayed in year. This was due to the need to secure approval from France. Discussions are still on-going, but are dependent on the outcome of the French Government's spending review that is currently being undertaken. There will now be at least a 19 month gap between the existing capability leaving service and the new missile being available. The Department may extend the life of the existing missile to mitigate the gap.

The 50% confidence delivery forecasts for the Training Capital Equipment (TCE) (aircrew and maintainer) have been revised in light of emerging technical and programme risks, recent changes to delivery dates published by the prime and sub-contractors and continued manpower resource pressure within the Project Team. For the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter Fielding Plan and InService Date these equipments are on critical path hence the In-Service Date has moved commensurately. The revised Training Capital Equipment delivery dates are as follows:
Full Mission Simulator - December 2013, Cockpit Procedures Trainer - February 2014, Aircraft Systems Trainer - November 2013 and Weapons &amp; Avionics - February 2014.</td>
