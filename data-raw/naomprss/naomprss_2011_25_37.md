A400M

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

A400M is Planned to Provide Tactical and Strategic Mobility to all Three Services. the Required Capabilities Include: Operations from Airfields and Semi-Prepared Rough Landing Areas in Extreme Climates and all Weather Conditions by Day and Night; Carrying a Variety of Equipment Including Vehicles and Troops over Extended Ranges; Air Dropping Paratroops and Equipment; and Being Unloaded with the Minimum of Ground Handling Equipment. the 1998 Strategic Defence Review Confirmed a Requirement for an Airlift Capability to Move Large Single Items Such as Attack Helicopters and some Royal Engineers’ Equipment and Concluded that this Would be Met, in the Latter Part of the First Decade of the 21st Century, by Future Transport Aircraft. the A400M Was Selected to Meet this Requirement. It will Replace the Remaining Hercules C-130k Fleet.

A400M is a Collaborative Programme Involving Seven European Nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and United Kingdom). the Design Phase is Nearing Completion and Manufacture Activities Have Commenced. Delivery of the First UK Aircraft to the Royal Air Force is Expected in 2014.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

The Government Announced in December 1994 that it Would Replace Its Ageing C-130k Hercules Fleet, in Part by Procuring 25 C-130j’s from Lockheed Martin and in Addition, Subject to Certain Conditions, by Rejoining the Next Phase of the Collaborative Future Large Aircraft Programme (Now Known as A400M). the Future Large Aircraft ‘initial Gate’ Approval Was Achieved in July 1997 and in the Same Year the Solution Assumed for Costing Purposes Was Changed to an Initial Lease of Four C-17 and Subsequent Procurement of 25 Future Large Aircraft. a Request for Proposals Was Issued to Airbus in September 1997 on Behalf of the Seven Future Large Aircraft Nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey and UK). Subsequently, in July 1998, Four Nations (Belgium, France, Spain and UK) Issued a “competitive Request for Proposals” for a Future Transport Aircraft to Airbus Military (A400M), Boeing (C-17) and Lockheed Martin (C-130j).

Proposals Were Received on 29 January 1999 and Parallel National and International Assessments Were Undertaken. These Covered Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisal, Technical and Commercial Compliance, Risk Assessment, and an Appraisal of the International Dimensions. This Work also Led to Parallel Negotiations and Clarification with the Three Bidders. at the Direction of the Equipment Approvals Committee in December 1999, Additional Work Was Undertaken to Inform the Main Gate Submission. on 16 May 2000 the Government Announced the Decision to Procure 25 A400M Aircraft to Meet the Future Transport Aircraft Requirement.

## A.3. Progress

In October 2010, the Strategic Defence and Security Review Confirmed A400M as One of the Components of the Future RAF Air Transport Fleet. It also Announced that the Hercules C-130j Tactical Air Transport Aircraft Would be Withdrawn from Service in 2022 Rather than at the Previously Declared Out of Service Date of 2030.

In March 2010, Agreement Between A400M Partner Nations and Airbus Military on Re-Baselining the Programme Set the Framework for Negotiations to Amend the Development and Production Contract. the Negotiations, Led by Officials from Each Partner Nation, Examined all Aspects of the Revised Programme and Continued until November 2010 when the A400M Programme Board (the Senior Multi-National Governance Body of the Programme) Indicated that They Were Content with the Outcome of the Negotiations and Recommended that the Tabled Contract Amendment be Ratified by Partner Nations. a Period of National Staffing and Approvals then Commenced, which Ended with the Signature of the Amended Design and Production Phase Contract on 7 April 2011. as Reported in the Major Projects Report 2010, the Contract Amendment Means that the UK will Receive 22 A400M, Rather than the 25 Expected under the Original Contract.

Positive Achievements on the A400M Development Programme Have Included the Addition of Three more Prototype Aircraft to the Flight Trials Fleet (Making their Maiden Flights Respectively on 8 April, 9 July and 20 December 2010). Together the Trials Fleet Had Amassed over 1404 Flying Hours by 27 March 2011. the A400M Made Its First Visit to the UK, Landing at Its Future Main Operating Base RAF Brize Norton on 16 July 2010.

A400M

## A.4. Capability Risks

Not Proceeding with this Capability Would Significantly Reduce the UK’s Tactical Air Transport Capability Due to Having to Rely Solely on C-130j Aircraft to Provide Support to Operations after the C-130k Out of Service Date in 2012. Furthermore, not Proceeding Would Mean that the UK will not Have any Tactical Air Transport Capability after 2022, (the Revised Out of Service Date for the C-130j Declared in the Strategic Defence and Security Review) and less than the Planned for Strategic Lift Capability, as it Would be Dependant Solely on the Current Fleet of Seven C-17 Aircraft.
