# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

The Advanced Air-launched Anti-Armour Weapon (AAAW), known as Brimstone, is designed to reduce the fighting power of enemy armoured forces as early and as far forward as possible. It replaces the BL755 cluster bomb in the anti-armour role, and will be carried by Tornado GR4/4a, Harrier GR9 and Typhoon. These fixed-wing aircraft will complement the capability provided by the Apache AH64D, which is armed with the Hellfire anti-armour weapon. Brimstone operates autonomously after launch, which helps reduce the hazard to the attacking aircraft from enemy fire. The longer reach and speed of deployment of fixed-wing aircraft mean that they can engage armour far beyond the battlefield area, and before it can join the contact battle.

Following an international competition an AAAW development and production contract was let in

November 1996 to GEC-Marconi Radar and Defence Systems (later Alenia Marconi Systems, now MBDA) for the Brimstone system. The In-Service date for Brimstone was declared on 31 March 2005.

## 3e. Operational impact of ISD variation

The ISD delay of 42 months results in the lack of a fully effective anti-armour capability and the run-on of BL755 in the anti-armour role. However, 12 months of the delay were necessary to align Brimstone ISD with the availability of its Tornado GR4/4a platform.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Approval was given for feasibility studies to be carried out in 1982. However, during Options for Change, programme funding was withdrawn while alternatives for a future anti-armour capability were considered. The project was reinstated in 1993 and the revised Staff Requirement for an Advanced Air-launched Anti-armour Weapon (AAAW) was presented to the Equipment Approvals Committee (EAC) early in 1994.

In June 1994, the EAC gave approval for an Invitation to Tender (ITT) to be issued to industry for an AAAW. Following issue of the ITT in December 1994, proposals were received from GEC Marconi, Hunting Engineering, Texas Instruments, Thorn EMI and British Aerospace.

Following full technical and commercial assessment of the proposals a further tender round took place in January 1996. This concentrated on the commercial aspects of the bids in line with revised timescales and production quantity requirements.

The tender assessment was completed in February 1996 with the findings being presented to EAC. Brimstone was found to have superior relative performance by a comfortable margin and also provided the most cost-effective solution. In July 1996 the Secretary of State for Defence announced that GEC Marconi had won the AAAW competition with its Brimstone weapon, and would be awarded the contract to develop and produce the weapon system.
