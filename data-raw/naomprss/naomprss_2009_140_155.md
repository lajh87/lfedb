• Post Main Investment Decision - Falcon Increment A, Falcon Increment C

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Falcon will provide the comprehensive deployable communication systems that are needed at all levels of command and will operate in conjunction with systems such as Bowman, Cormorant, Skynet 5 and with allies’
communication and information systems. It will not duplicate the capability of existing systems, but will be the high capacity system that binds together tactical communications in a theatre of operations as an integral part of the plans for Networked Enabled Capability. Falcon will replace, incrementally, a number of current systems, in particular Ptarmigan.

The programme comprises a number of increments of which only Increments A and C are reflected in this report. Increment A will provide a tactical formation level secure communication system for the High Readiness Force (Land) and the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. It will enable units to be deployed rapidly to areas of crisis, thereby allowing the UK to remain a pivotal member of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. The system will be modular and upgradeable, incorporating much off the shelf technology that will ease management of obsolescence throughout its service life. Increment C, providing capability for Royal Air Force deployed operating bases, is the same equipment as contracted under Falcon Increment A. Falcon Increment A will require significantly less manpower to operate than the system being replaced.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

Increment A of the Falcon programme gained Initial Gate approval in July 2002, following an extended Concept Phase that considered two key options: buy off the shelf technology (Bowman and Cormorant) or buy new capability. It was concluded that a new capability was required.

Marconi Selenia (now Selex) and BAE Systems Insyte were selected for the 15 month Assessment

Phase contract and to compete for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase prime contract for

Increment A. The Assessment Phase contracts concentrated on reducing the risk in the proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture phase, including demonstration of components and subsystems to achieve an acceptable, affordable, low risk solution. In addition, Whole Life Cost estimates were refined. Bidders’ proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture phase were submitted on 31 March 2004.

The procurement strategy endorsed at Initial Gate comprised four increments: Increment A provided for High Readiness Force (Land) and the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps; Increment B for UK divisions and brigades under armour; Increment C for Royal Air Force deployed operational bases; and Increment D for littoral warfare and deep support, including higher mobility. Increment D was then an unfunded aspiration. During the later stages of the Assessment Phase in 2004/2005, a savings option removed funding from the first two years of the Demonstration and Manufacture phase, resulting in a review of the incremental procurement strategy. Two options were considered. The first was for a single programme that effectively would have combined all three funded increments. This would have necessitated the project returning to pre-Initial Gate status and delayed the ISD by up to four years. This option was adopted as the planning assumption and reflected in MPR 2005. The second option was for the delivery of “early capability” that would provide for one medium scale deployment by 2010. It would utilise the savings option funding profile and exploit the existing contractor bids for Increment A. This option was explored and found to be viable.

In July 2005, approval was given to the further in-depth exploration of the second option and the selection of BAE Systems Insyte as the preferred bidder for Falcon Increment A. A programme was developed in conjunction with the preferred bidder that was affordable within the available funding.

Falcon Increment C achieved Main Gate approval in July 2007 and was added as a Falcon Increment A contract amendment in September 2007.

## A.3. Progress

Following Main Gate approval for Increment A in March 2006, the Demonstration and Manufacture contract was awarded to BAE Systems Insyte. Negotiations to acquire the MAN 6 Tonne Support Vehicle have been completed. The majority of the system has been developed to a high degree of maturity and the system validation and verification process started, but there have been delays to the voice telephony sub-system and the cryptographic sub-system, which have had a consequential delay to the whole contract. The Equipment Acceptance Trial, now contracted for late 2009, will be a key milestone in the system’s development.

Later increments (Increments B and D) are now known collectively as Future Falcon. Future Falcon is planned to provide tactical communication systems for the more mobile Division/Brigade level and for deep support roles. Future Falcon is currently in early Concept and further Falcon Increments will be subject to separate approvals.

A study was approved by Director Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition & Reconnaissance and added to the Falcon contract. This explored the integration of Defence Information Infrastructure (Future Deployed) to the Falcon capability identifying a technical solution. Three costs for integration were proposed; a firm price of £18M pre Equipment Acceptance Trial, and two Rough Order Magnitude costs of £42M post Equipment Acceptance Trial but pre System Field Trial and £67M post System Field Trial. The firm price option although affordable was turned down by the Defence Equipment & Support commitment regime. Consequently a work around will need to be managed to allow Falcon to interoperate with Defence Information Infrastructure (Future Deployed) until this integration work is taken forward.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Falcon Increment A and Increment C will deliver secure one-to-one voice and wideband data networks to deployed forces, including Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, Divisional and Brigade

Headquarters and unit level command posts and Deployed Operating Bases. Without this capability Land and Air Forces will be unable to execute effective command and control. In addition, Falcon Increment A and Increment C will also provide wideband data coverage for vital intelligence gathering platforms such as Airborne Stand Off Radar, Land Environment Air Picture Provision and Watchkeeper. Without the wideband data network delivered under Falcon this intelligence information will not be delivered to the key decision makers in a timely fashion. Falcon Increment C will also support the increased data requirements of new aircraft such as Typhoon and will allow them to operate from Deployed Operating Bases.

From an Interoperability perspective Falcon will not work with Defence Information Infrastructure (Future Deployed) or any other Microsoft based Information System. In order to mitigate against some of these interoperability issues configuration changes will be made to Falcon, however, the result of doing this effects the ability of Falcon to survive in a hostile electromagnetic environment.
