SOLDIER TECHNOLOGY

(FIST)

Integrated Project Team Responsible:

DISMOUNTED CLOSE COMBAT

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Ground Manoeuvre)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT the REQUIREMENT

The Future Integrated Soldier Technology (FIST) Programme Aims to Integrate both Current and Emerging Key Technologies that British Dismounted Soldiers Require for Them to Maintain their Position in the Forefront of Capability. the Programme will Ensure the Future Soldier Has Equipment that Optimises Effectiveness, Reduces Physical and Psychological Load, and Minimises the Effects of Combat Stress and the Risks of Human Error.

Historically, Soldiers Have Been Equipped in a Piecemeal Manner. FIST will Consider the Dismounted Soldier as a System, and the Eight-Man Section as the Platform. This ‘system of Systems’ Approach, Demonstrated Successfully During the Concept Phase, will Fundamentally Improve the Capabilities of Troops Engaged in Dismounted Close Combat. FIST will Deliver an Integrated Suite of Equipment Encompassing the NATO Domains of C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information), Lethality, Mobility, Survivability and Sustainability.

# SECTION 2: THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

Note: Actual in Service Dates and Costs are not Set until Projects Reach the Point in Time when the Main Investment Decision is Made Ie Main Gate Approval. Until this Point all Costs and Dates are Outline Assumptions Solely for Internal Planning Purposes. 2a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Initial Gate Approval Was Achieved in August 2001. Four Companies Submitted Tenders for the Assessment Phase (AP) Prime Contract, and a Two-Stage Selection Process Was Adopted (Four to Two and Two to One). Two Companies Were De-Selected in August 2002, Leaving BAE Systems and Thales Defence Ltd to Take Part in a Competitive Planning Phase Between August 2002 and January 2003. the Selection of Thales Defence Ltd as the FIST AP Prime Contractor Was Announced on 12 March 2003.

The AP Prime Contract Was Expected to Take 32 Months but Commitment of Troops to Operations Overseas Delayed Critical Trials Planned for Summer 2004, Leading to an Extension of Three Months and a Cost Increase of £2.5m. Problems Were Encountered on a Subsequent Major Trial Held in Autumn 2005,

As some Systems Proved Insufficiently Robust to Allow Adequate Data to be Collected. Consequently, more Time is Needed to Mature Our Understanding of the Requirement and of the Final Technical Solution. the Revised Estimate of the Cost of the AP Has Therefore Been Increased by a Further £5m to a Total of £33m.

<td Colspan="3">the FIST Project is Intended to Provide Dismounted Soldiers with an Integrated Suite of Equipment that Optimises their Effectiveness on the Battlefield. Soldiers Have Hitherto Been Equipped in a Piecemeal Manner, but FIST will Regard the Individual Soldier as a System. the Main Gate Business Case will be Submitted for Approval Once the Work Currently Being Carried Out in the AP Has Reached Maturity. the Main Gate Business Case will Seek Approval for Demonstration and Production of a Range of Equipment to Deliver the Required Capability.</Td>
