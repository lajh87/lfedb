UTILTY VEHICLES

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Primarily Utility Vehicles will equip the A2020 Utility Vehicles Infantry Battalions and the supporting Combat Support e.g. Artillery and Engineers and Combat Service Support e.g. Medics and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.

The Army ‘battle groups’ its assets to deliver combined arms capability meaning Utility Vehicles Battalions elements will operate with Armoured (Challenger 2) and Armoured Infantry (Warrior) groupings, amongst others. Similarly Combat Support and Combat Service Support elements will also operate in such groupings and be equipped with Utility Vehicles. Utility Vehicles will therefore cover a multitude of roles across the full spectrum of operations including:

· Rapid intervention type operations

· Enduring peace enforcement and peace-keeping type operations ·
Enduring support to heavy forces on high-intensity combat operations.

There are 2 critical operational drivers for Utility Vehicles:

· Replace obsolete/obsolescent armoured vehicles throughout Defence

· To deliver and sustain capable armoured platforms more quickly over strategic distances

The Utility Vehicle User Requirement Document (URD 1084) remains extant and defines a fleet of medium weight armoured wheeled vehicles to replace the obsolete Saxon and aging Fighting Vehicle 432 legacy platforms

Utility Vehicles was originally part of the Future Rapid Effect System programme. In December 2008 the Equipment Examination restructured the programme prioritising Scout Specialist Vehicles Reconnaissance Block 1 over Utility Vehicles.

## A.2. The Concept Phase

Planning Round 09 savings option (E09GM226S) deferred all Utility Vehicles funding for 3 years until \\\. Planning Round 11 savings option (E11GM114S) further deferred all Utility Vehicles funding until Financial Years \\\ whilst maintaining the Planned Assumption for Service Entry of \\\.

## A.3. In-Year Progress

Pre-concept work is underway between Director Combat (Sponsor) and Defence Equipment and Support to refine the roles and associated requirements for Utility Vehicle as part of the Armoured Vehicle Programme Estimate before programme re-launch in 2015.

## A.4. Capability Risks

If the UK does not generate Medium Forces capable of Rapid Effect and with demonstrable war-fighting capability, there will be three main impacts:

1.  The majority of the Armoured Fighting Vehicles in the Armoured and Mechanised brigades will be obsolete by \\\ (less Challenger 2 and Warrior).

2.  The UK would lack both a viable Medium Weight Capability and Medium Force Capability, \\\. For Rapid Intervention or intervention into land-locked theatres, the UK is already reliant upon either Light Forces \\\ or Heavy Forces \\\. c. \\\
