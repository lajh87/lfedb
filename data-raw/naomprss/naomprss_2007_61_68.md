POST MAIN GATE PROJECT SUMMARY SHEET

FALCON

Integrated Project Team Responsible:

THEATRE AND FORMATION COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS (TFCS)

Single Point of Accountability for project capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Command, Control & Information Infrastructure)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

FALCON will provide the comprehensive deployable communication systems that are needed at all levels of command and will operate in conjunction with systems such as Bowman, Cormorant, Skynet 5 and with allies’ communication and information systems. It will not duplicate the capability of existing systems, but will be the high capacity system that binds together tactical communications in a theatre of operations as an integral part of the plans for Networked Enabled Capability (NEC). FALCON will replace, incrementally, a number of current systems, in particular Ptarmigan.

The programme comprises four increments of which only Increment A is reflected in this report. Increments B, C and D are planned to provide tactical communication systems respectively for the more mobile Division/Brigade level, for Royal Air Force deployed operating bases and for littoral warfare and deep support roles.

Increment A will provide a tactical formation level secure communication system for the High Readiness Force (Land) (HRF(L)) and the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC). It will enable units to be deployed rapidly to areas of crisis, thereby allowing the UK to remain a pivotal member of the ARRC. The system will be modular and upgradeable, incorporating much off the shelf technology that will ease management of obsolescence throughout its service life. FALCON will require significantly less manpower to operate.

Following Main Gate approval for Increment A in March 2006, the Demonstration and Manufacture contract was awarded to BAE Systems Insyte. Gainshare negotiations to acquire the MAN 6 Tonne Support Vehicle are at an advanced stage. The Increment A Equipment Acceptance Trial, currently contracted for early 2009, will be a key milestone in the system’s development. Further FALCON Increments will be subject to separate approvals.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Increment A of the Falcon programme gained Initial Gate (IG) approval in July 2002, following an extended Concept Phase that considered two key options: buy off the shelf technology (Bowman and Cormorant); and buy new capability. It was concluded that a new capability was required.

Marconi Selenia (now Selex) and BAE Systems Insyte were selected for the 15 month Assessment Phase (AP) contract and to compete for the Demonstration and Manufacture (D&M) Phase prime contract for Increment A. The AP contracts concentrated on reducing the risk in the proposals for the D&M phase, including demonstration of components and subsystems to achieve an acceptable, affordable, low risk solution. In addition, Whole Life Cost estimates were refined. Bidders’ proposals for the D&M phase were submitted on 31 March 2004. The procurement strategy endorsed at IG comprised four increments:

Increment A provided for HRF(L) and the ARRC; Increment B for UK divisions and brigades under armour; Increment C for RAF deployed operational bases; and Increment D for littoral warfare and deep support, including higher mobility. Increment D remains an unfunded aspiration.

During the later stages of the AP in 2004/2005, a savings option removed funding from the first two years of the D&M phase, resulting in a review of the incremental procurement strategy. Two options were considered. The first was for a single programme that effectively would have combined all three funded increments. This would have necessitated the project returning to pre-IG status and delayed the ISD by up to 4 years. This option was adopted as the planning assumption and reflected in MPR 2005. The second option was for the delivery of “early capability” that would provide for one medium scale deployment by 2010. It would utilise the savings option funding profile and exploit the existing contractor bids for Increment A. This option was explored and found to be viable.

In July 2005, approval was given to the further in-depth exploration of the second option and the selection of BAE Systems Insyte as the preferred bidder for Falcon Increment A. A programme was developed in conjunction with the preferred bidder that was affordable within the available funding.
