<th>
The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Service will provide the Air-to-Air Refuelling and the passenger Air Transport capability currently provided by the Royal Air Force’s fleet of VC10 and TriStar aircraft. Air-to-

Air Refuelling is a key military capability that significantly increases the operational range and <sup>Enter Text Here</sup>endurance of front line aircraft across a range of Defence roles and military tasks.</th>

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft was nominated as a potential Private Finance Initiative project in 1997. An Assessment Phase, designed to confirm whether a Private Finance Initiative would offer best value for money, was launched following Initial Gate approval in December 2000.

The Assessment Phase confirmed industry’s ability to meet the service requirement, programme

^Enter\ Text\ Here^timescales and costs and determined that the inclusion of passenger Air Transport capability in the contract would represent value for money. It also clarified the manning and personnel implications.

# A.3 Project History since Main Gate

The Main Gate Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in January 2007 and was approved in May 2007. In March 2008 a 27 year Private Finance Initiative contract was signed.

The final Approval envelope for Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft was set by the Investment Approvals Board in June 2008.

The Investment Approvals Board approved Contract Not To Exceed cost remains at £10.5 Bn. In addition there will be Front Line Command manpower and support costs leading to a total cost of £12.3 Bn.

The successful maiden flight of the first green Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft A330-200 aircraft took place on the 4th June 2009; the aircraft was subsequently delivered for conversion to the Airbus Military purpose-built hangar facility Getafé in Spain on the 10th July 2009. It was joined by the second Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft aircraft on the 7th September 2009; both aircraft have now been converted for their Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft role, which includes fitting of military avionics as well as the specialist refuelling equipment. Following this work both aircraft moved into the Certification and

Enter Text HereQualification programme.

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is not simply about the procurement of aircraft, but covers all aspects of an integrated worldwide aircraft service, ranging from the provision of the infrastructure, including a hangar complex (which allows for the maintenance of two aircraft simultaneously and houses the two Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Squadrons, the maintenance crew; operations centre and associated office accommodation), a full flight crew and engineer training service, despatch and ground support. The new facility, known as the AirTanker Hub, was completed ahead of schedule and was officially opened on 31 March 2011, for the provision of the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft service at Royal Air Force Brize Norton.

The construction of the training facility building was completed ahead of schedule, and will become fully operational towards the end of 2012.

# A.4 In-year Progress

TEMPEST and Defensive Aids Sub System testing began at Boscombe Down on 18 April 2011 and Ground testing for Air to Air Refuelling with receivers began in May 2011.

European Aviation Safety Agency issued the Supplemental Type Certificate 1 and 2 to Airbus Military on 20 April 2011 and 29 July 2011 respectively.

MOD and Air Tanker signed a contract on 11 July 2011 to allow C130 Hercules aircraft to use the hangar for line maintenance.

Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox named the Future Strategic Transport Aircraft ‘Voyager’ at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Royal Air Force Fairford on 15 July 2011.

Cobham achieved the UK Civil Aviation Authority approval for the extension to their European Aviation

Safety Agency Part-145 accreditation, to include Base and Line Maintenance for the Airbus A330-243 series aircraft on 23 August 2011, signifying the beginning of the conversion programme at Cobham.

On the 10 October 2011 the Civil Aviation Authority issued the Part 145 & M Certificate to Air Tanker Services. This completed the set of Air Tanker Services deliverables for Introduction to Service. Because of problems in the trials programme and delay in delivery of documentation from Air Tanker, the Introduction To Service date slipped to February 2012.

The first Voyager aircraft arrived at Royal Air Force Brize Norton on 21 December 2011. On arrival, Air Tanker registered the aircraft and obtained the Civil Aviation Authority Certificate of Airworthiness.

The originally planned flight trials to clear wing pod Air to Air Refuelling for Tornado and Typhoon finished in December 2011. These trials identified problems associated with fuel leakage at various parts of the Air to Air Refuelling clearance flight envelope. Rectification plans for these issues were finally agreed with Air Tanker and the Independent Technical Adviser on 31 January 2012.

The Simulator Test Readiness Review completed successfully on 10 January 2012.

The Type Certification Exposition version 5 for Air Transport &
Aeromed 3 was issued on 2 February 2012.

Capability Acceptance at Introduction To Service acknowledged that only the Air Transport and Aeromed 3 elements of the capability had been achieved on 2 February 2012, but not achievement of an acceptable Air to Air Refuelling capability.

The Director Air Support signed the Voyager Release To Service Recommendation for Air Transport and Aeromed 3 only, on 21 March 2012, and the Release To Service was signed by the Assistant

Chief of the Air Staff on 4 April 2012. The Aircraft was placed on the Military Aircraft Register on 5 April 2012

# A.5 Capability Risks

The first VC10 aircraft entered service in the 1960s and these were converted to Air-to-Air refuelling tankers at various dates between 1980 and 1996. The aircraft has ageing and outdated technology, and the risks to maintaining reliability and value for money have grown and ultimately it will not be possible to sustain capability. These VC10 aircraft are planned to go out of service in 2013. The TriStars aircraft first entered airline service in the early 1970s and converted to their current tanker and tanker/freight roles between 1983 and 1987. These aircraft are planned to go out of service in 2014.

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft programme will provide the Royal Air Force with a reliable, safe and efficient Air Transport and Air to Air Refuelling service until its Out of Service Date in 2035.

Enter Text HeThe primary role for the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft will be Air-to-Air Refuelling, and the objective e of these operations is to enhance combat effectiveness by extending the range, payload or endurance, of front line fast jet aircraft and large aircraft types where and when it is needed. Without Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft, a significant gap would appear in the UK’s strategic deployment and tactical strike capabilities. In addition the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is able to transport up to 291 passengers.
