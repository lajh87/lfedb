# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Type 45 is a New Class of Eight^\^ Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers, to Replace the Capability Provided by the Royal Navy’s Existing Type 42s. the Warship is Being Procured Nationally. the Type 45 will Carry the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) which is Capable of Protecting the Vessels and Ships in their Company Against Aircraft and Missiles, Satisfying the Fleet’s Need for Area Air Defence Capability into the 2030s. PAAMS is Being Procured Collaboratively with France and Italy. the Type 45 Integrated Project Team is Responsible for Providing PAAMS to the Warship Prime Contractor.

BAE Systems Electronics Was Appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999 and a Contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture (DFM) for the First Three Ships Was Placed in December 2000. a Contract Procurement of a Further Three Type 45s Was Placed with the Prime Contractor in February 2002. the Ships are Being Built under Sub-Contract by BAE Systems Naval Ships and VT Shipbuilding.

The Past Year Has Seen Significant Progress in the Manufacture of the First Three Ships. the First Ship, HMS Daring, Was Launched February 2006 and During the Course of the Next Year will be Fitted with Most of Her Equipment Ahead of Her First Sea Trials in 2007. the Second, HMS Dauntless, and Third, HMS Diamond, Ships are on Schedule. Main Manufacture of the Fourth Ship, HMS Dragon, Starts During 2006. on the PAAMS Programme, the Sampson Multi-Function Radar Has Demonstrated Its Ability to Track Targets; a Production Standard Long Range Radar is in Operation at the Type 45 Shore Integration Facility; and the Aster Missile Development Programme is Nearing Completion Following a Number of Successful Firings During 2005.

\ the Type 45 is a Planned Class of Eight Ships. Approval Has, so Far, Only Been Given for Six Ships. It is on the Approval of Six Ships that the Major Projects Report is Presented.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Type 45 Destroyer Programme Builds on the Assessment Work Carried Out in Phase 1 of the Collaborative HORIZON Project, the Warship Element of the Common New Generation Frigate Programme. Following the Decision of the Three HORIZON Partners (France, Italy and the United Kingdom) to Proceed with PAAMS, but to Pursue National Warship Programmes, BAE Systems Was Appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999. the Contract for PAAMS Full Scale Engineering Development and Initial Production Was Placed in August 1999. Main Gate Approval for the Warship Was Achieved in July 2000 and a Contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture Was Placed in December 2000.

\ the Assessment Phase Costs Approved at Initial Gate Did not Take into Account that all Expenditure on the WR21 Engine Was to be Treated as Assessment Costs Rather than Manufacturing Costs

1.  T45 Destroyer is a Legacy Project that Drew Upon Concept Work of Project Horizon and Future Frigate. T45 Did not Formally Go Through Initial Gate, but for MPR2000, the NAO Agreed that EP11/91 Should be Equated as Initial Gate for T45.

2.  This Aligns with the Derived Date for Initial Gate Above. T45 is a Legacy Project Building on the Assessment Work Carried Out Inphase 1 of the Collaborative Horizon Project.
