BOWMAN and TACTICAL COMMUNICATIONS & INFORMATION SYSTEM (BATCIS)

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Command, Control & Information Infrastructure)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Bowman and Common Battlefield Application Toolset, Digitisation Battlespace Land Infrastructure and Platform Battlefield Information System Application Programme (BCIP) will Provide a Secure Tactical Voice and Data Communications System for all Three Services in Support of Land, Littoral and Air Manoeuvre Operations. It will Replace the Increasingly Obsolete Clansman Combat Radio System and the Headquarters Infrastructure Element of the Ptarmigan Trunk System. BCIP Comprises of a Series of Incremental Upgrades Such as BCIP4, BCIP5.

In September 2001, Following International Competition, General Dynamics United Kingdom Ltd Was Awarded the Bowman Supply and Support Contract as Prime Contractor, and Conducted Its Own Competition among Sub-Contractors. on the Basis of Brigade Scale Operational Field Trials Bowman Achieved Its in-Service Date (ISD) on 26 March 2004. in 2005, the First Converted Brigade Deployed to Iraq on Operation TELIC, with a Core Bowman Capability Alongside Its Residual Clansman Capability. Continued Operational Experience Indicates that Bowman is Delivering a Battle Winning Capability. Littoral Manoeuvre (Amphibious) Operational Readiness Date Was Declared in December 2005 and Planning Continues to Declare Land and Air Manoeuvre Operational Readiness.

During 2005, a Review of the BCIP Programme Provided the Opportunity to Better Ensure that it Would Deliver a Capability Consistent with the MoD’s Vision of Achieving Network Enabled Capability. a Review Note Was Approved in July 2006 and Formal Offer of Contract for the
‘recast’ Programme Was Accepted by the Prime Contractor. a Validation Phase Has Begun that will Define a Number of Risk Reduced Options that will Inform a MoD Main Gate Submission, in Mid 2008, for Future Capability Enhancements.

By 31 December 2006, 7,000 Platforms Had Been Converted and Conversion of all Available Platforms to BCIP 4.f is Expected by December 2007. Dependent on a Successful Brigade Operational Field Trial 3 in October 2007 and Acceptance & Release Decision in December 2007, Fielding of BCIP5 is Expected to Take Place from January 2008.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Bowman Was First Approved in 1988, when it Was Expected to Have the Equivalent of Main Gate in 1993 and ISD in 1995. After Feasibility Stage 1 in 1993, Contracts Were Placed with Two Competing Consortia for Feasibility Stage 2 (FS2) and Project Definition Stage 1.

FS2 Indicated that the Risk of Procuring and Integrating the Local Area Sub-System (LAS) Would be Best Managed by Placing the Responsibility with the Bowman Contractor. This Change in Procurement Strategy Was Approved in 1997, along with Bowman Core Risk Reduction Work.

In November 1996, the Previous Two Consortia Formed a Joint Venture Company, Archer

Communications Systems Ltd (ACSL) to Submit a Joint Bid for Bowman. the Department Approved a Single Source Strategy for Bowman Following a Review of Procurement Options. a Risk Reduction Contract Was Placed with ACSL in August 1997. ACSL Received a Further Package of Work in October 1998 Worth £182m Prior to Production Commitment at Main Gate, then Planned for November 2000.

The Department Rejected ACSL’s Bid in July 2000, Removed their Preferred Supplier Status and Relaunched the Competition, as it Was not Convinced ACSL Could Meet an Early ISD. TRW Ltd, Computing Devices Canada Ltd (CDC), Now General Dynamics UK Ltd, and Thales Defence Ltd Competed for the Contract, which Was Won by CDC in July 2001. the Equipment Approvals Committee Gave Main Gate Approval in August 2001 and the Bowman Supply and Support Contract Was Signed on 13 September 2001.
