# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Joint Military Air Traffic Services project seeks to sustain the provision of Air Traffic Management at MOD Airfields and Air Weapons Ranges through the provision of new capability to meet new regulatory airspace management requirements set by the Civil Aviation Authority, addressing equipment obsolescence in the air traffic inventory and through the more efficient delivery of support services. The project will provide air traffic services to military and civilian aircraft arriving at, departing from and operating within the immediate vicinity or confines of, MOD aerodromes (United Kingdom, overseas permanent and deployed) and at air weapons ranges.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The assessment phase of the Joint Military Air Traffic Services project is being conducted in two parts. The first part (Assessment Phase 1) was approved on the 17^th^ January 2008. The purpose was to both express the military air traffic services in output terms through the development of an output based specification and to determine the most appropriate and cost effective delivery solution for this service. In addition, the project has captured data on the condition of the existing air traffic control infrastructure (control towers, radar towers, radio masts etc) as well as the number of people employed in supporting the service. Part 1 of the Assessment Phase completed in October 2009 with the submission of a Review Note seeking approval for Part 2.

Part 2 of the Assessment Phase enables formal industry engagement. The intention is to use the competitive dialogue process to determine the preferred bidder and delivery solution for the Joint Military Air Traffic Services within the delivery framework developed during Assessment Phase Part 1.

## A.3. Progress

A Review Note Industry Engagement was issued in December 2009 seeking approval to initiate formal industry engagement and release of an additional £6M to provide specialist technical support and external assistance to the competitive dialogue process. Approval for Part 2 of the Assessment Phase was given on 22 February 2010.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Much of the equipment that currently provides air traffic services to MOD airfields and ranges is in excess of 20 years old and is obsolete. Increasing regulation of United Kingdom airspace requires the implementation of new radar surveillance capability. Failure to invest in this capability will ultimately reduce the level of air traffic service provision to these locations. This will reduce the ability of all three Services to train and fly and hence the ability to project air power wherever and whenever it is required.
