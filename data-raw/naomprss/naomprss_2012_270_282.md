<th>Specialist Vehicles will provide the next manned ground reconnaissance capability. The Scout platform and supporting variants will offer improved fightability, survivability, lethality, and have a greater find capability than the increasingly obsolescent legacy Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) fleet. Specialist Vehicles will provide a mobile, protected ground platform for reconnaissance to fill a capability gap and will contribute to a combined arms capability of modern, medium-weight, strategically deployable, tracked vehicles. The current planning assumption is to deliver a Reconnaissance fleet of up to  vehicles incrementally.</th>

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

GENERAL: Future Rapid Effects System Specialist Vehicles entered its assessment phase (Assessment Phase 2) in June 2008. The approval covered the anticipated Specialist Vehicles fleet scope, with high priority afforded to Scout (Recce Block 1), given the pressing need to replace Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked). Specialist Vehicles was assumed to consist of three Recce Blocks plus Medium Armour and Manoeuvre Support components, all mounted on a common base platform. In broad terms the Assessment Phase Studies confirmed that the Common Base Platform concept was viable for all platforms and also set the time, cost performance and risk envelope for Recce Block 1. In accordance with the endorsed acquisition strategy, the Common Base Platform design will be used for Recce Block 2 and 3 with the addition of role specific sub-systems for each variant. Assessment studies will be used to determine the scope of each sub-system fit for each specific role.

TRADE-OFFS: Assessment Studies were used to derive the preferred Programme Option and its associated characteristics of performance (requirements), cost, time and risk, ahead of launching a competition to select the Prime contractor. These studies included an analysis of potential solutions ranging from off-the-shelf platforms, modified off-the-shelf, and new design, as well as studies on critical sub-system choices e.g. primary sighting system. Industry was engaged throughout to ensure data used reflected market reality, whilst still keeping competitve choices open. The Military Customer and User were engaged throughout the process.

ACQUISITION STRATEGY: Assessment Phase 2 also determined the most approporiate Acquisition Strategy for the Specialist Vehicles. The product of this strand was subject to a separate Investment Approvals Board Approval. This Approval endorsed the use of open international competition to select a 'prime contractor' to conduct the demonstration phase for Recce Block 1, and subject to further approval included progression to manufacture and initial inservice support, together with a Common Base Platform for all Specialist Vehicles. Major enabling sub-systems e.g Guided Weapons (missiles) for later Recce Blocks were not included in the scope of Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform in order to leave competitive choice for later Recce Blocks e.g. missile coherence with Team Complex Weapons.

<th>MAIN WEAPON SELECTION - SCOUT: Approval for the selection of the 40mm Case Telescope Weapon System was given in 2008 to enable commonality with the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme, thus taking the benefit of common ammunition and training. Qualification for the 40mm Case Telescoped Weapon System is led by the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme team. The Recce Block 1 element of Assessment Phase 2 was conducted in four Stages, with the key findings from each stage captured in a stage report. The final stage - the formal competition and Investment Approvals Board approval for Demonstration was conducted under an aggressive timeline with transition through Main Gate 1 achieved seven months ahead of forecast. In 2010, the project was subject to re-approval by the new coalition government which delayed contract award by three months, due to the pre-election period. Assessment Phase 2 included risk reduction studies and demonstrators on the Specialist Vehicles platforms and on high performance thermal imaging sighting systems which were subsequently down-selected as part of the main competition. The Recce Block 1 element of the Assessment Phase 2 concluded with a major international competition, which selected General Dynamics UK Ltd as the Prime Contractor. Further Assessment Phase work is planned for later Recce Blocks. The Future Rapid Effect System Specialist Vehicles Assessment Phase 2, discussed above, (approved in 2008) largely, but not exclusively, focussed on Recce Block 1 and the Common Base Platform for all the roles. It was planned that the Assessment Phase would be subject to further approval once more work had been conducted on the complete Specialist Vehicles requirement set, particularly the later, more complex variants.</th>

# A.3 Project History since Main Gate

MAIN GATE 1 - DEMONSTRATION RECCE BLOCK 1 ONLY: The outcome of the Specialist

Vehicles Assessment Phase for Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform was presented as evidence for the Specialist Vehicles Main Gate 1 approval for entry into Demonstration. As part of this Main Gate 1 approval, the Office of Government Commerce conducted a Gateway Review in September 2009, followed by a full Major Projects Review Group examination in December 2009, which confirmed that Specialist Vehicles was in a position to proceed to its planned

Demonstration phase with General Dynamics UK Ltd as the Prime contractor. Approval was reendorsed by the new Coalition Government in June 2010. The contract with General Dynamics UK Ltd commits to the Demonstration Phase for Recce Block 1 only, whilst taking contractual option (prices - to be exercised later) for manufacture for Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform options for later Blocks and initial in-service support. This contract includes seven Anchor Milestones.

Planning Round 11 and Strategic Defence and Security Review Savings Options have removed the Medium Armour element and reset the total vehicle fleet numbers up to \\\, with the delivery profile recast to aspire to the emerging Army restructuring under Strategic Defence and Security Review (Five Multi Role Brigades). Final size and shape of the Specialist Vehicles fleet will not be set until

Main Gate 2, in \\\, when the first major production investment decision will be taken. The Recce Block 1 Planned Assumption for Service Entry was also deferred by nine months from \\\ to \\\
due to a Strategic Defence and Security Review savings option.

FURTHER APPROVALS - Manufacture and Demonstration of other Recce Blocks: It should be noted that Specialist Vehicles does not have a single Main Gate Approval. The size of the programme, together with previous lessons learned in other programmes, determined that a two stage Main Gate approach should be used; Main Gate 1 for entry into Demonstration for Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform only, with a second Main Gate (2) for entry into production, the latter being the major investment decision. Further approvals (in effect sub-Main Gates) will approve Demonstration and Manufacture of later vehicle blocks (e.g. Recce Block 2) covering later variants. Main Gate 1 did not set Initial Operating Capability, Full Operating Capability or total fleet requirements, but merely noted the planning assumptions associated with these for service entry at the time of demonstration launch for Recce Block 1. There was also recognition that the then forthcoming Strategic Defence and Security Review would change total fleet requirements and assumptions and these should not therefore be set at Main Gate 1.

# A.4 In-year Progress

Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform Demonstration:

Building on the initial progress started in 2011, the programme has successfully completed its stage payment milestones for:

1.  Integrated Baseline Review and System Design Review of the Turret

2.  System Design Review

3.  Preliminary Design Review of the Platform

4.  Entry review into the Preliminary Design Review Anchor Milestone.

An Information Note was submitted in June 2011 to the Internal Approvals Committee noting the enduring need for the Specialist Vehicles project after the Strategic Defence and Security Review, with change to the Defence Planning Assumptions and Planning Round 11. It also noted the assumption that General Dynamics UK Ltd would be the Prime Contractor for Recce Block 2 subject to demonstrating value for money and Internal Approvals Committee approval through a Review Note planned for later in 2012 following the announcement of Planning Round 12. A number of Programme Options have been scoped out during the year to inform this planning round, and as of 31 March 2012 no formal decision has been taken on which Programme Option would be run in Planning Round 2012.

In February 2012, an opportunity arose to conduct extra cannon integration tests & mine blast characterisation by 31 May 2012 at no cost or compromise to MoD. These trials provide additional design maturity understanding on exit from Preliminary Design Review, as useful risk reduction for Critical Design Review later in the project. Exit from the Preliminary Design Review is dependent on presentation and acceptance of maturity evidence and continuing risk reduction plans going forward.

1.  Capability Risks

Specialist Vehicles will replace Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) which is increasingly becoming tactically un-deployable. Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) has already been extended beyond it’s out of service date through a series of modifications and Urgent Operational Requirements. Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) is restricted by its very small design meaning that it has reached its operational capacity. Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) must be replaced (by Specialist Vehicles) to avoid a long term capability gap opening up in essential manned ground reconnaissance.
