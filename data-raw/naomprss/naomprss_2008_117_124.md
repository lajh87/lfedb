Integrated Project Team Responsible:

JOINT ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition & Reconnaissance)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Soothsayer Integrated Ground Based Electronic Warfare System will Provide the Supported Commander with a 24 Hour, all Weather Source of Intelligence, Through Its Communications and Non Communications Electronic Support Measures Capability. the System Detects, Locates and Identifies Radio and Radar Signals. in Addition, Soothsayer will Provide an Integrated Communications Electronic Counter Measures System. Soothsayer Replaces a Number of Systems Including Odette and the Interim Non-Communications Equipment.

Following a Competitive Assessment Phase, a Demonstration and Manufacture Contract Was Placed with Lockheed Martin (Owego USA) in August 2003. Soothsayer will be Delivered in Three Main Phases. the First Phase, which Includes Communications Electronic Support Measures and Interim Communications Electronic Counter Measures, is Expected to be Delivered in 2009 (in Service Date). the Second Capability Phase is Planned for Delivery by 2010. Under both Phases the System will be Fitted to the Meonic (Previously the Light Role Supacat High Mobility Transport 6\6) Soft Skin Vehicle. the Third Phase, which is Planned for Delivery in 2013 Subject to Armoured Vehicle Availability, will Provide an Armoured Communications Electronic Support Measures and Non Communications Electronic Support Measures Capability.

Delay in the Development and Delivery of the Meonic Vehicle Resulted in a Slip to the in Service Date and an Increase in Procurement Costs Being Declared in January 2005. Vehicle Reliability Issues Have Been Addressed and First Phase Deliveries are Now Complete. However, Technical Issues with the Development and Testing of the Communications Electronic Support Measures System Have Led to the Forecast in Service Date Being Further Delayed.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Initial Gate Business Case for Soothsayer Was Approved in August 1999. Following a Competition, Two Prime Contractors, Lockheed Martin and Thales Defence Were Selected to Provide a Technical Solution along with Costs, Risks and Timescales for a Demonstration and Manufacture Phase. Originally, Down-Selection to One Prime Contractor Was Planned for the End of the Demonstration Phase. in April 2002, an Extension to the Assessment Phase and Further Risk Reduction Work Was Approved, and Agreement Given to Down-Selection at Main Gate Approval.

## 5b. Cost of the Assessment Phase

| £m (Outturn Prices)       | Assessment Phase Cost | Proportion of Total Estimated Procurement Expenditure |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Actual Cost                   | 24                        | 11%                                                       |
| Approved Cost at Initial Gate | 19                        | 9%                                                        |
| Variation                     | +5                        |                                                           |
