# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Typhoon

Typhoon, formerly known as Eurofighter, is an agile multi-role combat aircraft. Originally designed primarily, but not exclusively, for air superiority, the aircraft is also capable of delivering a precision ground attack capability. Typhoon has the flexibility to respond to the uncertain demands of the current and evolving strategic environment.

The aircraft is being developed, produced and supported in a collaborative project with Germany, Italy and Spain. The project is managed on behalf of the four Partner Nations (PN) by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA). To date, contracts have been placed for the RAF to receive 160 aircraft in three tranches. Typhoon support is being delivered through the letting of long-term contracts against five areas of support.

Typhoon Future Capability Programme

The Typhoon Future Capability Programme will provide enhancements to the Typhoon aircraft, both in the air-to-air and air-to-surface roles, to sustain the RAF’s Typhoon fleet’s multi-role capabilities.

The first phase of the Future Capability Programme, under a contract signed in March 2007, will integrate Paveway IV and the Litening III Laser Designator Pod onto Tranche 2 aircraft from 2012 onwards as well as interoperability upgrades without which those aircraft will be neither compliant with new civil airspace regulations nor interoperable with key coalition allies. It will also provide the Human Machine Interface for Multi-Role operations, allowing Typhoon to fulfil air-to-air and air-to-surface operations with the current, planned and projected weapons.

The Department will continue to develop the Typhoon capability incrementally in line with the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

Typhoon

Pre-Development, which commenced with the approval of the feasibility study in 1984, comprised a number of activities. Following early concept studies, and various efforts at establishing a collaborative programme, there were two key Typhoon demonstration activities completed by the UK before development: the Experimental Aircraft Programme, an airframe programme primarily aimed at proving the feasibility of the Typhoon unstable flight control concepts, and the XG40 engine demonstrator programme at Rolls Royce. The results of these demonstrators and their associated studies, together with the results of similar work within the other Nations were harmonised in a Definition, Refinement and Risk Reduction phase that ran from the end of 1985 when four Nations signed the initial Memorandum of Understanding, until 1988 when the development contract was signed.

Typhoon Future Capability Programme - Phase 1

The approval process for Typhoon Tranche 2 noted the intention to develop the capability of the aircraft through life and envisaged an incremental route to the acquisition of future capability enhancements. The Assessment Phase found technology and integration were not a major challenge and that risks mostly pertained to the commercial and industrial aspects of the programme. These have been addressed and the MOD approvals process for the project was accelerated to combine Initial Gate, including the cost already incurred during the Assessment Phase, and Main Gate in order to maximise efficiency across the four PN.

The UK has embarked on an Extended Assessment Phase to assess technologies that would meet its requirement for an Electronically Scanned Radar to replace the existing mechanically scanned radar. The embodiment of this technology on to Typhoon aircraft will provide a considerable operational and export enhancement for the aircraft and add to the growing formidable array of weapons operationally available.

## A.3. Project History

Typhoon has been in service with the RAF since 2003 and commenced operational duties for the first time in June 2007 when it assumed Quick Reaction Alert responsibility for defence of UK airspace. Deployable Air Defence operational status was achieved on 1 January 2008, which enables Typhoon to deploy worldwide on air-to-air missions. Typhoon was declared to NATO in the deployable Air Defence – Advanced role on 1 April 2008. Typhoon assumed Quick Reaction Alert responsibility for defence of South Atlantic Islands airspace in September 2009, taking over from Tornado F3.

The existing advanced air-to-air missile capability on Tranche 1 aircraft has been complemented by the integration of an initial precision air-to-surface capability, which was declared combat ready by the RAF in July 2008. This air-to-surface capability enabled declaration of multi-role status and is in advance of more comprehensive air-to-surface capability through the Typhoon Future Capability Programme for Tranche 2 aircraft.

Deliveries of Tranche 2 aircraft commenced in October 2008. The original Typhoon fleet numbers required (232 aircraft) were established in the 1990s. Current fleet planning and assumptions to meet defence requirements have determined the aircraft numbers and capabilities required now (160 aircraft). The contract for the third Tranche, signed in July 2009, represents the best solution for the UK in balancing current military requirement and international obligations against affordability. The UK has retained the option to order further aircraft. Deliveries of Tranche 3 aircraft commenced in December 2013.

The Typhoon Availability Service (TAS) contract with BAE Systems, signed in March 2009 formally commenced in September 2009. The Engine Availability Service contract with Rolls-Royce (PSOP 3) was signed in December 2009. These contracts are part of the strategy to transform support arrangements through partnering with UK industry.

Number 6 Squadron, the first Typhoon fighter squadron in Scotland, officially formed at RAF Leuchars on 6 September 2010. The Typhoon Force assumed Quick Reaction Alert (North) air defence responsibility from RAF Leuchars in March 2011. The outcome of the review into basing was announced by the Secretary of State for Defence in July 2011 and concluded with the closure of Leuchars as an Air Force base and move the Typhoon Squadron to RAF Lossiemouth, redeploying aircraft from 2013 onwards.

A proposal was made in May 2010 by the Eurofighter GmbH consortium to slow down the rate of production of Typhoon Tranche 3A aircraft for all four partner nations. The Typhoon partner nations agreed to this proposal in July 2011. The agreement on production slowdown aims to protect the industrial capacity of the Eurofighter partner companies to service export orders for Typhoon, while meeting the requirements of the PN. In March 2011, Typhoon aircraft were deployed overseas for the first time on contingent operations, in support of the coalition plan to enforce United Nations Resolution 1973 (Libya).

Following Typhoon’s first overseas contingent operational deployment in March 2011 on Operation ELLAMY, it was used initially in an air defence role and then as a ground attack aircraft against targets varying from tactical to strategic. The aircraft consistently demonstrated exceptional levels of reliability, performance, accuracy and overall cost-effectiveness over and above the MOD’s very high expectations.

Typhoon aircraft deployed on Operation ELLAMY returned to the UK in September 2011.

In June 2011 the Ministers of the four PN signed an agreement which signalled their intent to develop an operational requirement for an Electronically Scanned radar for the Eurofighter programme which would aim to introduce a harmonised new radar onto the aircraft, also enhancing the exportability of the aircraft to new overseas customers.

Typhoon capability upgrades continue to be progressed and capitalise on the aircrafts growth potential, demonstrated during the early stages of its operational life as a multi-role air defence platform in the 21st century. Planned upgrades include; the integration of the Meteor Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile, following its successful launch from a Typhoon aircraft in 2012; continuing work to mature the technology required to replace the existing mechanically scanned radar with a new electronically scanned radar.

An announcement was made December 2012 for the contract between BAES and the Sultanate of Oman for the delivery of 12 Typhoon aircraft to the Royal Omani Air Force. This has increased the number of Typhoon users to seven.

Under the programme known as Retrofit 2, 43 Typhoon aircraft have been upgraded to the Tranche 1 Block 5 standard, which includes installation of the Forward Looking Infra-Red system, sensor fusion and the enhancement of air-to-air capability.

Typhoon undertook it first ‘major’ maintenance interval after completing 1,600 flying hours. The ‘major’ maintenance programme typically takes around nine months per aircraft to complete and is carried out under the TAS contract at RAF Coningsby.

Typhoon played a key role during the 2012 Olympics by providing air defence capability when they were deployed to RAF Northolt to protect London as part of Operation Olympic Guardian. The aircraft also took part in fly pasts over London during the Diamond jubilee celebrations.

The first phase of the Future Capability Programme has shown good progress now that the project schedule has been re-baselined, through joint working between the Department and Industry. This accommodated the 18 month delay which was highlighted in Major Projects Report 2012.

The Typhoon front line fleet continues to build with well over half of the contracted deliveries of 160 aircraft in three Tranches now in service with the RAF.

The Governments continued commitment to the growth in Typhoon capability was marked when the

£130m contract between NETMA and Eurofighter GMBh to integrate the Meteor missile system onto Typhoon was signed at the Paris Airshow in June 2013, during a ceremony attended by Ministers of the PN of the Typhoon/Eurofighter programme.

The Typhoon Future Capabilities (FCP1) Programme introduces precision air-to-surface bombing capability on Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 standard of aircraft. The programme is delivered in two sequential phases, the first of which (P1Ea) was accepted into service with the RAF (1 Squadron) in December 2013. The precision bombing capability is provided principally via the integration of Paveway IV bomb and Laser Designator Pod in service acceptance followed an earlier successful test firing of this weapon in July 2013.

The planning for integration of further capability upgrades under the wider FCP programme includes

Storm Shadow, Meteor and additional Air to Ground Weapons. The United Kingdom, along with the other PN, are jointly committed to integrate an Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar on to Typhoon and we are working closely with Industry to finalise arrangements for bringing this capability into service, subject to the usual approvals processes. The addition of this capability will further enhance both the operational capability and the exportability of this formidable aircraft, which is already in service with the Air Forces of 6 Nations.

In November 2013 the Ministers of the Eurofighter/Typhoon Nations instigated a programme that underlined their collective commitment to improve the working relationships and create more efficient and agile working practices to build on and improve a programme of European Transformation.

The Typhoon fleet continued to grow as planned, with 117 aircraft delivered to the RAF by the end of March 2013. The last of the Tranche 2 aircraft and the first of the 40 new Tranche 3a aircraft were delivered at the end of December 2013.

The Department extended the TAS support contract for a further year in December 2013. Throughout 2013 and into 2014 the Department continued to get to grips with cost control for Typhoon support, by contracting accounting consultants to conduct a ‘Deep Dive’ into the £13Bn Support budget to ensure it remains under control and affordable over the life of the aircraft through to it’s planned Out of Service Date (OSD) of 2030. The combination of this activity and Ministerially endorsed European Transformation programme underlines the Governments commitment to continued cost control and the long-term affordability and exportability of Typhoon.

## A.4. In-Year Progress

The Governments continued commitment to the growth of Typhoon capability was marked by the signing of two key weapon integration agreements during the period. A £120M agreement was signed at the Farnborough International Air Show in July 2014 to integrate the Storm Shadow missiles onto Typhoon. Storm Shadow will provide long-range-air-to-surface capability and will be fitted to Typhoon Tranche 2 and 3 aircraft. This was followed by the £165M contract for the Typhoon Phase 3 Enhancements (P3E) programme, which was awarded in February 2015. The P3E programme will deliver a number of upgrades to the UK’s Typhoon Tranche 2 and 3 mission and maintenance systems and includes the integration of the Brimstone 2 weapon system that will introduce a short range, low collateral damage weapon capability designed specifically to combat fast moving surface targets. It is anticipated that both Storm Shadow and Brimstone 2 will be ready for service with the RAF in 2018.

The Typhoon Future Capabilities (FCP1) Programme introduces precision air-to-surface bombing capability onto Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 aircraft. The second of two sequential phases (P1Eb) was delivered into service with the RAF in July 2014 and declared operational in April 2015. The precision bombing capability is provided principally through the integration of the Paveway IV bomb and Laser Designator Pod.

In September 2014, Typhoon aircraft of 1 (Fighter) Squadron relocated from RAF Leuchars to RAF Lossiemouth. Along with 6 Squadron, they provide Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) cover for the north of the UK, together with QRA South, based at RAF Coningsby. From 2015, Leuchars will become home to the Army.

An £800M contract for the development of a new electronic radar system for Typhoon was awarded in November 2014. The contract, which followed the UK’s signing of a £72M technology de-risking and demonstration
‘Extended Assessment Phase’ with BAES in July 2014; marks the next stage in the full development of an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar capability for Typhoon. The introduction of an AESA radar will support new mission capabilities for Typhoon, through simultaneous multirole air-to-air and air-to-ground tracking of targets with increased fidelity and range, whilst utilising the Radio Frequency spectrum for Electronic Warfare.

The Typhoon fleet continues to grow as planned, with 127 aircraft delivered to the RAF by the end of March 2015. In December 2014 Typhoon Tranche 3 Release to Service (RTS) was declared. The 40 Tranche 3a aircraft will be delivered to the RAF by 2018, and along with the 67 Tranche 2 aircraft, will be the core of the Typhoon fleet through to it’s out of service date.

In December 2014 the Department extended the TAS contract for a further 15 months, to better align its future renewal with the international spares and repairs contracts which support it. The contract delivers aircraft depth maintenance to the RAF Typhoon Force, a spares and repairs management service, RAF aircrew and ground crew training and an engineering/technical resolution service, ensuring the availability of the RAF’s Typhoon fleet to meet the Military commitments.

## A.5. Capability Risks

Typhoon is intended to be a cornerstone of UK air defence and the aircraft will be pivotal to the delivery of Standing Home Commitments. Having replaced Jaguar in the ground attack role and with future reductions in other aircraft types, loss of Typhoon would reduce the UK's ground-attack and air superiority capabilities.

<td colspan="5">Typhoon's partnered support strategy was originally approved in 2000. Its principles were reinforced by the results of a 2004 Support Review. The partnered support strategy - referred to as Typhoon Future Support - will be delivered through the letting of long-term contracts against five areas of support through TAS on BAE Systems; the propulsion availability service PSOP on Rolls Royce; for Avionics (Spares Provisioning and Component Repair) via the NETMA; and for international Technical Support Services, also via the NETMA.valuable experience has already been gained through the letting of incremental contracts to transform Typhoon support, the first of which was the initial phase of the engine availability contract with Rolls Royce in 2005. Work is now well underway to implement changes to the contractual framework for support by replacing eleven legacy contracts with four new more efficient contracts, as a part of a wider European Transformation programme jointly introduced by PN and Eurofighter Gmbh. Two of the four Contracts were let in 2012 and work is now underway to let the remaining two. The UK has also developed a series of managed workstreams, focussing on the support costs of the Engine, Avionics Engineering sustainment and improved maintenance processes. Progress against these workstreams has continued during the year with efficiencies now starting to be realised in maintenance of the aircraft. All of these workstreams are specifically designed to manage support expenditure so that it stays within the current approval limit over the life of the aircraft. The TAS contract was extended for an initial one year from December 2013, with a further 15 month extension following in December 2014.</td>

Key improvements in capability not realised until revised ISD are: i) Agility and all altitude performance; ii) Autonomous detection, identification and multiple engagement of air to air targets;
iii) Human computer interface to reduce operator workload; iv) Multi role capability;
v) Survivability through superior airframe and equipment performance;
vi) Low mean time between failures. The 54 month delay has been mitigated to a small extent by compressing the entry into service period, but the net effect is a delay of four years.

Mitigations are in place to manage this risk against Typhoon’s tasks over the next 3 years, but this area will require further investment as Typhoon’s tasks grow in accordance with extant Planning Assumptions.</td>
