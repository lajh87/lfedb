• Support/Service/PFI - Hercules Integrated Operational Support

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Provision of a through-life partnered support contract for the Hercules C130 fleet until Out of Service Date for each platform. The Out of Service Date of C130K is 2012 and C130J is 2030. The contract will use a combined technical and supply chain approach, providing the RAF with flexible support, responsive to military requirements.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase A.3. Progress

Hercules Integrated Operational Support Contract was let with an effective date of 01 June 2006. Contract transition phase was completed in October 2007 with transition to full aircraft availability. The contract is based on current firm prices valid until 31 December 2010. Repricing activity for period 01 January 2011 to 31 December 2015 is due to commence 2009.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Hercules Integrated Operational Support contract replaced a mixture of Contractor Logistic Support contracts and traditional support contracts. There would be a capability risk to the Front Line Command, if Hercules Integrated Operational Support was cancelled, as this would mean that C130 aircraft would not be available to RAF. In order to replace Hercules Integrated Operational Support the legacy contracts would need to be re-instated which would mean the costs to support C130 fleet would be greater.
