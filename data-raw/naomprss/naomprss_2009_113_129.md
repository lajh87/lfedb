# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Military Requirement is for Up to 7-8 Astute Class Submersible Ship Nuclear to Replace the Existing Swiftsure and Trafalgar Classes of Nuclear Powered Attack Submarine.

Astute Class Submarines are Required to Perform a Range of Military Tasks; These Unique Requirements are Combined Within the Astute Design to Provide Global Reach, Endurance, Covertness, Sustained High Speed and the Ability to Conduct Unsupported Operations in Hostile Environments.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

In June 1991 (Equivalent of Initial Gate) Approval Was Given to Proceed with a Programme of Studies at an Estimated Cost of £6m (1991/1992 Prices) to Define the Batch 2 Trafalgar Class Boat (Now Known as the Astute Class). This Programme of Studies Led to the Issue of an Invitation to Tender for the Design and Build of an Initial Batch of Three Astute Class Submersible Ship Nuclear and a Further Approval of
£2m (1992/1993 Prices) for Contractor and Defence Research Agency Support to MOD During the Tendering Exercise in 1994.

In July 1994, as a Result of Concerns over the Overall Affordability of the Programme, Minister (Defence Procurement) and the Treasury Approved a Further £24m (at 1993/1994 Prices) for Risk Reduction Studies to be Undertaken in Parallel with the Formal Bid Phase of the Project. to Maintain an Effective Competition, Contracts for Risk Reduction Were Awarded to both Bidders, GEC Marconi (Now BAE Systems (Submarine Solutions)) and Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd.

GEC-Marconi Was Identified as MOD’s Preferred Bidder in December 1995. Using the Policy of No Acceptable Price No Contract, a Prime Contract Was Placed in March 1997 for the Design, Build and in Service Support of the First Three of the Class.

## A.3. Progress

BAE Systems Disclosed During 2002 Significant Delay and Projected Cost Overrun. an Agreement Between the Department and BAE Systems Was Reached in February 2003 Reducing Risk from the Production of Boats 2 and 3, and Placed New Incentives on the Company to Perform. the Department Agreed to Increase Funding by Around £430 Million, Against an Increased Contribution by the Company of £250 Million. an Amendment to the Boat 1 Contract Was Signed in December 2003 with Boat 1 Continuing on a Revised Target Cost Incentive Fee Arrangement; Boats 2 and 3 Continued on Ascertained Expenditure Pending Later Pricing.

After the Submission of a Review Note in 2007, a Further £580m Increase Was Agreed. This Was Coupled with Increased Inflationary Costs and some Programme Throughput Assumptions at the Barrow Site not Being Borne Out. All the Programme’s Revised Anchor Milestones Continue to be Met and New Project Management Disciplines Were Implemented. This Included Agreeing a Target Cost Incentive Fee with a Maximum Price for Each of Boats 2 and 3.

Approval for Procurement of Boat 4 Was Given in May 2007

Boat 1, the First of the Astute Class Was Launched in June 2007. on Completion of Initial Trials Boat 1 Returned to the Devonshire Dock Hall for Outfitting, which Included the Installation of the Reactor Core. During 2008 Several Technical Issues Arose, which Were Compounded by the Ten Year Gap Between the Vanguard and Astute Classes and the Erosion of the Skilled Resource at Barrow. Additional Resources Have Been Applied to the Astute Programme to Minimise the Impact, but the Resolution of These Issues Has Introduced a Ten Month Delay to Boat 1’s in Service Date. Preparatory Activities for Boat 1’s Sailing Including Crew Training for the First Phase of Sea Trails Remain on Track.

A Review Note is Being Submitted to the Investment Approvals Board Seeking Re-Approval of Boat 1’s in Service Date, the Implications of this on the Remainder of the Astute Class Programme are under Investigation, and will be the Subject of a Separate Review Note in Late 2009. Approval Was Given in December 2007 for Long Leads Items for Boat 5, to the Cost of £494m.

A Savings Measure Option Was Taken in 2009 to Remove £139m of Funding from Astute Boats 2-7 in Years 2009/10 to 2012/13. These Savings Result in Delayed Delivery of Boats 2-4, which are Already in Build and Defer Build Start Dates and the Procurement of Long Lead Items for Boats 5-7. as a Consequence of This, Cost Growth Occurs in Later Years.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Delivery of Boat 1 is Critical to Attack Submarine’s Readiness Profile. Boat 1’s Delay will Result in the Delayed Introduction of Improved Capability over Current Classes. the Astute Class will also De-Risk Capability Essential for an Affordable Successor Deterrent Programme.

The Initial Astute Support Solution Was Approved in July 2006; it Follows a Traditional Support Model, but Recognises Astute’s Differences and Introduces Additional Arrangements as Appropriate. Provision Has Been Made to Employ the Build Contractor (BAE Systems) as the Astute Technical Authority, MOD will be the Approving Authority, and Nuclear Propulsion Project Team is Responsible for the Nuclear Steam Raising Plant. MOD Equipment Project Teams will Support Specific Equipments with Director in-Service Submarine Maintaining a Platform Focus and Providing the Flotilla Wide Single Point of Contact for Fleet. Maintenance at the Waterfront will be Conducted under Existing Warship Support Modernisation Initiative Arrangements. the Astute Class Training Service is a PFI Contract, Initially Approved for 36 Years to Provide Astute Specific Training to the Royal Navy for Boats 1-3. Approval Was Given in 2007, to Extend to a 38 Year Contract, to Cover the Life of Boat 4.
