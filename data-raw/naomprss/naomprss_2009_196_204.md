• Post Main Investment Decision - Queen Elizabeth Class

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The requirement for the Queen Elizabeth Class was endorsed in the Strategic Defence Review which identified a continuing need for rapidly deployable forces with the reach and self-sufficiency to act independently of host-nation support. The Strategic Defence Review concluded that the ability to deploy offensive air power would be central to future force projection operations, with carriers able to operate the largest possible range of aircraft in the widest possible range of roles. This analysis was further endorsed by the New Chapter work of 2002 and the Defence White Paper in December 2003. The current Invincible Class of carriers was designed for Cold War Anti-Submarine Warfare operations. With helicopters and a limited air-defence capability provided by a relatively small number of embarked Sea Harriers, it was judged that this capability would no longer meet future United Kingdom requirements. It was therefore decided to replace the Invincible Class with two larger and more capable aircraft carriers. The class’ offensive air power will be provided primarily by the Joint Combat Aircraft. The Joint Force Air Group is an air group comprising of a mix of aircraft, tailored to the mission need; it will typically consist of both fixed and rotary-winged aircraft including joint air assets e.g. Joint Combat Aircraft.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The Class received Initial Gate approval in December 1998 and Invitations to Tender were issued in January 1999. Following tender evaluation, competitive firm price contracts for the Assessment Phase, each potentially worth some £30m, were awarded to BAE Systems and Thales UK in November 1999. Initially, the Assessment Phase was broken down into two stages. The first involved the examination of several carrier designs, and helped inform the decision in January 2001 to select the United States, Joint Strike Fighter as the option with best potential to meet the Joint Combat Aircraft requirement. Stage 1 completed in June 2001, following which proposals from the contractors for Stage 2 were considered, together with an assessment of their views on the level of work needed to adequately de-risk the programme. After careful consideration, the conclusion was reached that the original two-stage approach no longer offered value for money and the Assessment Phase strategy was changed.

The competitive second stage was revised and shortened (completing in November 2002) and enabled the competing contractors to concentrate on refining their designs and taking key trade-off decisions. An innovative Continuous Assessment process was used throughout to evaluate the contractors' performance which led to the conclusion that an alliance approach involving BAE Systems, Thales UK and the Department represented the best approach to Future Aircraft Carrier. The innovative Alliance procurement strategy will enable the full exploitation of the resources and strengths of the alliance participants with the shared objective of improving on agreed performance targets and was announced in January 2003. A third stage of assessment was therefore taken forward on this basis to further increase the maturity of the design and determine the alliancing strategy for Future Aircraft Carrier. Stage 3 completed in March 2004.

In July 2004, the Assessment Phase was extended into Stage 4 to further mature the design and carry out risk reduction work, to ensure that the best technical & procurement solution was achieved. Alliancing principles were agreed with BAE Systems and Thales UK and further developed with the selection in February 2005 of Kellogg, Brown & Root UK Ltd as an additional participant in the Alliance. The timescale for completing the design and risk reduction work was further extended in August 2005 (into Stage 5) although this did not result in any additional cost to the programme. The Assessment Phase completed end January 2006 at a revised total cost of £298m, (following receipt of Interim Cost

Certificates from the alliance participants). Final Assessment Phase figure will be confirmed upon receipt of Final Cost Certificates.

## A.3. Progress

Following direction from the Investment Approvals Board, the project has adopted an incremental approach to Main Gate approval with the Demonstration and Manufacturing Phases being divided into two sequential Main Gate approval points. The first phase (Demonstration), which included expanding the alliance to include Babcock Engineering Services and VT Shipbuilding, was approved by the Investment Approvals Board and Treasury in December 2005. The total cost of the Demonstration Phase (excluding Indirect Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit, but including non recoverable VAT) was approved at £297m (not to exceed). The Demonstration Phase activity completed in mid 2008 with total expenditure to 31 March of £266m. The second and final Main Gate approval, to proceed with the Manufacturing Phase of the project was announced by Secretary of State on 25 July 2007 at a not to exceed cost of £3900m including the capitalised Assessment Phase costs and Demonstration Phase costs.

In March 2006, the UK agreed a Memorandum of Understanding that provides for the supply to France of a common baseline design data pack to enable French industry to bid for the design, manufacture and support of one Future Aircraft Carrier (France). France has paid an initial entry fee and contributed to the costs of the UK Demonstration Phase.

Following Main Gate approval the project moved into the Engineering Transition Phase, an extension of the Demonstration Phase to encompass the period prior to contract signature. On 3 July 2008 a contract was signed with BVT Surface Fleet for the manufacture of the two carriers together with signature of an Alliance Agreement with all members of the alliance. Since then, Infrastructure preparations and equipment procurement have proceeded with equipment sub-contracts placed by the end of 2008 in excess of £500m. On 11 December 2008, Ministers announced the outcome of MOD’s Equipment Examination including the intention to re-profile the Queen Elizabeth Class project to meet near term priorities and improve the scope of alignment with the Joint Combat Aircraft programme. The re-profiling measure is expected to result in a delay of one to two years to In-Service Dates and escalation of overall project cost. Manufacture is now underway with pre-fabrication of steel for lower block one starting in December 2008 and first cut of steel in the main Aircraft Carrier Alliance yards expected later in 2009.

The Aircraft Carrier Alliance programme indicates the potential of an In Service Date by middle of 2016.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Class is, together with Joint Combat Aircraft, Maritime Airborne Surveillance & Control and Maritime Auxiliary Replenishment Ships, an essential element of the Carrier Strike programme. Without this capability, the UK will be unable to project air power from the sea or to project the full level of medium scale offensive air effort and precision strike from the sea.
