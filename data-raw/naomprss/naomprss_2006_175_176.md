# SECTION 1: ABOUT the REQUIREMENT

The UK Military Flying Training System will Deliver a Coherent, Flexible and Integrated Flying Training Capability Catering for the Needs of the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the Army Air Corps.

The Flying Training System Takes Aircrew from Initial Training Through Elementary, Basic and Advanced Flying Training Phases to their Arrival at their Designated Operational Aircraft. the Current System is at Risk of Being Unable to Deliver the Required Quantity and Quality of Aircrew to Meet the Input Standard for the Operational Conversion Units.

The Existing Training Platforms are Approaching the End of their Useful Lives and Include Outdated Systems that are Unable to Prepare Trainees for Current and Future Front Line Aircraft, Such as Typhoon, Joint Combat Aircraft, A400M and Apache. the Current System is Based on a Number of Separate Contractual Arrangements for the Provision of Equipment and Support. Consequently the System is Piecemeal, Difficult to Manage and Inefficient. It also Introduces Significant Delays Due to Lengthy Training Programmes and Gaps Between Courses.

The Focus for UKMFTS is to Achieve a Holistic System Based on Capability and Service Delivery; it is not Solely About the Provision of Aircraft Platforms. It also Offers an Opportunity to Modernise the Flying Training Processes for all Three Services, Realise Efficiencies And, Since Training is Currently Spread Across Several Organisations, Take Advantage of Potential Economies of Scale.

# SECTION 2: THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

Note: Actual in Service Dates and Costs are not Set until Projects Reach the Point in Time when the Main Investment Decision is Made i.e. Main Gate Approval. Until this Point, all Costs and Dates are Outline Assumptions Solely for Internal Planning Purposes.

## 2a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Four Possible Procurement Options Were Identified at Initial Gate. the
‘do-Nothing’ Option Was Discounted. the Do Minimum Option Would not Deliver the Required Quality and Quantity of Students

169

In the Correct Timescales, but will Continue to be Considered Up to Main Gate. the Remaining Options, Public Private Partnership/Private Finance Initiative (PPP/PFI) and Smart Conventional, Were Tested in a Convergence Phase which Concluded that the Adoption of a PPP Contractual Partnering Model Would Best Harness the Collective Skills of MOD and Industry by Utilising a Mix of PFI and Conventional Procurement to Deliver a Coherent and Flexible System of Systems.

This Option Envisages the Appointment of a Training System Partner (TSP) to Work with the MOD over the Life of the Project to Deliver Incrementally the Total Aircrew Training Requirement. the Strategy Was Approved by Investment Approvals Board (IAB) in February 2005. an Invitation to Negotiate Was Issued to Three Consortia in March 2005;
The Bids Were Received in August 2005 and are Currently Being Assessed.

Main Gate Approval will be Sought when the Business Case is Sufficiently Mature. Additional Assessment Work will be Required Post-Main Gate for the Different Training Platforms that will be Acquired Incrementally. These Increments will be Subject to Further Approvals.
