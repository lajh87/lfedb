BEYOND VISUAL

RANGE AIR to AIR MISSILE

Integrated Project Team Responsible:

BEYOND VISUAL RANGE AIR-to-AIR MISSILE

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Theatre Airspace)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (also Known as Meteor) will Provide Typhoon with the Capability to Combat Projected Air-to-Air Threats and Sustain Air Superiority Throughout the Life of the Aircraft. Until Meteor is Integrated, Typhoon will be Armed with the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, Contracted to Raytheon Missile Systems.

Key Features of the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile Requirement Include Stealthy Launch, Enhanced Kinematics (Giving Increased Stand-Off and Disengagement Ranges, a Better Ability to Chase and Destroy Highly Agile Manoeuvring Targets) and Robust Performance Against Countermeasures.

This is a Collaborative Programme With: Germany, Spain and Italy (for Typhoon), Sweden (for Gripen) and France (for Rafale). the Contract for the Demonstration, Manufacture and Support of Meteor Was Placed with MBDA UK Ltd on 23 December 2002. Only the United Kingdom Has Committed to Production; the Contract Includes Production Options that can be Exercised by Partner Nations During the Demonstration Programme. the Unavailability of Typhoon Aircraft for Development and Integration Trials Has Delayed the Development Programme. This Has Therefore Had to be “realigned”, with Tornado F3 Introduced as the Primary Trials Platform, Supplemented by the Additional Use of a Gripen (with the Aspiration of Re-Introducing Typhoon into the Programme as Missile Development Becomes more Mature).

The Department Has Reviewed the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile Programme in 2007/08 in the Light of the Changing Strategic Environment and Has Decided to Delay the Integration of Meteor Onto Typhoon as this Capability is No Longer Required as Early as Previously Foreseen. Although the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile Programme Remains Well Within Its Approved Cost at Main Gate, the Review Work Has Shown that Previously Projected Savings Could not be Delivered to the Extent Estimated.

## 3e. Operational Impact of ISD Variation

Extend Reliance on the Current AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile. the Capability of the Latter Falls Significantly Below that of Meteor; Its Procurement Was a Temporary Solution to Provide Typhoon’s Anti-Air Capability for the Period Between Typhoon Operational Employment Date and Meteor ISD. Whilst the ISD Delay is not Expected to Affect Peacetime Air Policing, the Survivability and Capability of Typhoon in Almost all Operational Roles Would be Compromised by an Extended Delay. a Staged Transfer from Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile to Meteor is Necessary Owing to the Latter’s Delivery Profile, and Hence Use of Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile by Typhoon Extends Beyond Meteor ISD. There is some Risk that Part of the Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile Stocks will not Endure until the Revised ISD and Hence We may Fall Below the Minimum Required Stockpile Liability, Although this Cannot be Confirmed at Present.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

On 2 October 1995, Minister (Defence Procurement) Gave Approval for the Issue of an Invitation to Tender for Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile. the Invitation to Tender Was Issued on 5 December 1995. Two Bids Were Received; One from a Consortium Led by Matra BAe Dynamics UK Ltd, and One from Raytheon Systems Ltd. After Extensive Analysis, it Was Decided that both Bids Contained Areas of Risk that Needed to be Addressed Before a Development and Production Contract Could be Placed. in May 1997, a Project Definition & Risk Reduction Phase Was Approved and Contracts Were Placed on both Bidders for a Period of One Year with Results to be Technically and Operationally Assessed Before a Final Decision Was Made. Both Project Definition &
Risk Reduction Contracts Were Let in August 1997 and Revised Bids Were Received in May 1998.

Due to the Complexity of the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile Assessment, the Need to Accommodate the Requirements of the Prospective Partner Nations and the Need to Go for Best and Final Offers Primarily as a Result of the French Request to Join the Programme, Main Gate

Approval Was not Achieved until May 2000. in His Statement to the House of Commons on 16 May 2000, the Secretary of State Announced that Matra BAe Dynamics Meteor Missile Had Been Selected.
