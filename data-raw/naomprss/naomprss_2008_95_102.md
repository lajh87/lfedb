# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon is a man-portable short-range anti-armour weapon to be carried and used by all Arms and Services and replaces the Light Anti-Armour Weapon 80 capability. Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon will provide a predictive line-of-sight capability out to a range of 600m, against main battle tanks and light armoured vehicles, when both stationary and manoeuvring, and have the ability to be fired from enclosed spaces and defensive positions. It will have a secondary role as a means of attacking structures. The project is an Enhanced Off-The-Shelf procurement, and includes the provision of training systems and support. The weapon system is being developed in conjunction with the Swedish Defence Material Administration. The Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon prime contractor is SAAB Bofors Dynamics of Sweden, with Thales Air Defence Ltd as the main UK subcontractor.

Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon will be used by all forces operating in the land environment.

The In Service Date for the Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon system has been delayed as a result of system qualification difficulties.

## 3e. Operational impact of ISD variation

The short range anti-armour capability in current operations is provided by the Interim Light Anti-armour Weapon procured under an Urgent Operational Requirement in 2005 to meet the capability gap created by the early withdrawal of Light Anti-Armour Weapon 80. The delay in the In Service Date of the more capable Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon system has had virtually no impact on current operations because there is no heavy armour threat. However, there would be an impact in the unlikely event of a requirement for a short range capability against modern heavy armour before the Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon ISD in April 2009.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon project predates SMART approvals and as such there was no Initial Gate or Assessment Phase. Following approval to issue an Invitation To Tender to conduct Project Definition studies in September 1997, and subsequent approval for the Project Definition Phase in July 1999, competitive firm price contracts were awarded in October 1999 to Matra BAe Dynamics in the UK and Celsius in Sweden. The delay between approval to issue the Invitation to Tender and contract award was caused by uncertainty over the future of the Medium Range TRIGAT anti-armour programme, and resulted in slippage to the forecast ISD. The Project Definition Phase contracts lasted up to 22 months and bids for the Demonstration, Manufacture and Support phases were received in January 2001. The contractors were required to confirm the performance of their baseline system, developing weapon enhancements and prototype training systems needed to meet Next Generation Light AntiArmour Weapon requirements.

Risk reduction and trade-off studies were undertaken and detailed management, milestone and trials plans produced. The opportunities for collaboration with other countries were explored and a Memorandum of Understanding with Sweden, facilitating joint development, was signed in June 2002.

Main Gate Approval to proceed to the Demonstration, Manufacture and Support phases, together with downselection to Saab Bofors Dynamics (formerly part of Celsius), was achieved in May 2002. Contract placement followed in June 2002.

| Approved Cost at Initial Gate | 18                        | 5%                                                        |
