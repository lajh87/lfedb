# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Cipher will provide protection for all of MOD’s sensitive information and communications both at home and overseas. The project encapsulates work to renew the MOD cryptographic inventory and key management systems. Cipher will replace a number of current systems, in particular the General Key Management System.

There are three business drivers for Cipher. The first is to overcome the obsolescence of existing equipment and key management systems. The second is to enable network agility and interoperability with our Allies. The final driver is to improve security and efficiency in the delivery of cryptographic services.

Cipher will be delivered in three increments. Increment 1 provides an Enduring Operational Capability, Increment 2 replaces all legacy services and Increment 3 providing the additional services required to satisfy new requirements.

The MOD uses three levels of technology maturity metrics. These are:

1.  Technology Readiness Levels to describe the levels of maturity that are embodied in systems.

2.  System Readiness Levels for the integrated systems.

3.  Information Readiness Levels which provide a meaningful measurement of the maturity of the information design.

Cipher is a large, complex information-centric programme, involving Government Communication

Headquarters (GCHQ) and therefore Information Readiness Levels have been selected to report against for this project.

1.  The Assessment Phase

Cipher is a combination of two earlier MOD projects, the Future Crypto Programme (Delivering the hardware) and Interoperable Electronic Key Distribution (the complementary system to deliver keying material, and other supporting configuration and management data). The Initial Gate approval, issued in August 2007, for a combined assessment phase for the two programmes authorised an assessment phase funding \\\ at 50% confidence with agreement that the funding could be increased to
\\\ at 75% confidence subject to written confirmation from Head of Capability that the additional funding was available. No delivery phase timescale or funding estimate was provided in the Initial Gate submission beyond the available ten year funding profile. However, an Information Note issued in December 2008 stated 2012 as the date for the Initial Operating Capability.

Following Initial Gate approval, two consortia were down-selected and awarded “Assessment Phase" contracts in November 2008 to evaluate potential options, develop solutions, undertake demonstration programmes and deliver costed delivery phase proposals. The competition was undertaken in accordance with the Initial Gate strategy and the Procurement Strategy and both consortia agreed to at least match MOD funding for their assessment phase programmes of work.

Recognising the importance of Cipher and its potential use across Government, the Government Communication Headquarters has engaged proactively, providing guidance on standards to ensure that the resulting solutions and services can be readily adopted by Other Government Departments and Partners Across Government and be interoperable with our Allies.

<th>In June 2010, the Defence Equipment and Support Performance Delivery Improvement Team issued a report on Cipher. Head of Capability responded by producing a Project Mandate defining the project vision, scope, outcomes, delivery timelines and Governance arrangements. An Information Note was submitted to the Investment Appraisal Board in January 2011 to notify of the changes necessary, with a review of progress being held in February 2011 at a 2-Star Foundation Milestone Review. A Review Note was submitted to the Investment Approval Board in April 2011 seeking approval for the revised project timescales, the adoption of an incremental acquisition strategy and a revision to the approved budgetary level for the assessment phase  representing an uplift of  to the Initial Gate approval at 50% confidence. The programme includes four key mitigation actions of a) maturing the incremental approach, b) enhancing the delivery team with additional MOD and Government Communications Headquarters staff, c) developing a detailed and resourced plan and d) improving stakeholder and benefits management. Of these, a, c and d have progressed well. This left mitigation action falling short with regard to additional MOD staff. The Review Note outcome resulted in contract amendments for both companies, increased spend for the extant project team (including Specialist Technical Support and Government Communication Headquarters staff) by virtue of the longer time frame and a proportion for Risk Reduction activities. The outcome of the February 2011 Foundation Milestone Review was to proceed, but with the direction that all outstanding actions from the Performance Delivery Improvement Treatment Phase would be addressed. The additional funding required for the delivery of the extended Assessment Phase was identified and revised staffing levels agreed. Funding was used to extend the contracts of Logica and Thales. Cipher proceeded with the successful completion of the tender evaluation process in February 2012. The public announcement of the preferred bidder was delayed (pending resolution of a number of significant commercially sensitive issues). As at March 2012, the intent remained to submit the Main Gate Business Case for Increment 1 to Investment Approvals Committee in September 2012. However in late 2011, Defence Equipment and Support 3 Star lead for Cipher Chief of Material Joint Enablers queried the maturity of the National Level 2 Design and Deliverability. As a result, a detailed review of the Procurement Strategy was required to precede the Main Gate decision. Representation from the preferred bidder joined the Project Team in Corsham. Both MOD and Government Communication Headquarters personnel worked closely and good progress continued to be made. The next phase of the project was completion of the National Level 2 design (a more detailed design which was needed to complete the Service Requirement Document) which was managed and delivered using Government Communication Headquarter ‘best practice’ System Engineering methodology and process. A number of Planning Round 2012 options were raised to re-align finances which would if taken, impact the project and collectively extend the transition period, delay the realisation of benefits and extend the life of the project (but overall affordability would have improved as a result). Both Planning Round Options were taken. As reflected in the completed (March 2012) Office of Government Commerce Level 3 Review (Investment Decision), the availability of sufficient Suitably Qualified Experienced Personnel in project manpower (Crown Servants) was a serious issue (AMBER/RED), and there was well known weaknesses in external governance and senior stakeholder support that that needed to be addressed. A coherent and appropriately resourced joint Crypto Modernisation Programme to coordinate and span MOD, Government Communication Headquarters and Other Government Departments (as applicable) activities in this area was set up. The Office of Government Commerce Gateway Level 3 Review again highlighted the high levels of technical risk inherent in the approach (i.e. to proceed to Main Gate in advance of completion of the Level 2 design).</th>

1.  In-Year Progress

The extended Assessment Phase contract \\\ was brought to an end in June 2013 \\\. Cipher as a project was brought to a carefully managed conclusion. Following this, an over-arching programme (the Crypto Capability Programme) was proposed to manage this complex capability as a whole. \\\ It was envisaged that the Crypto Capability Programme would include a number of projects. Some of these are already well established, but there will also be an incremental series of new projects (each subject to approval at an appropriate level) to modify or deliver discrete elements of the capability. A long-term progressive transition is now envisaged.

1.  Draft Review Note was raised \\\ in late Summer 2013. The final version of the Review Note was presented in March 2014. \\\ The Investment Appraisal Committee gave authority to formally close down Cipher as a project and also gave retrospective approval for In-Year spend under the auspices of the Crypto Capability Programme. The Investment Appraisal Committee directed that a revised Review Note should be presented for June 2014; reflecting a more incremental approach, focused on the most immediate capability priorities.

1.  Capability Risks

Since July 2013, work has focused on addressing the capability gaps that exist in the short to medium term, ahead of any modernised end-to-end system. A Cipher Review Note was taken by the Investment Approval Committee in March 14 which approved the formal closure of Cipher. The Investment Approval Committee also directed the Delivery Team to submit a Review Note addressing short term obsolescence and approved sufficient funding headroom to achieve this milestone. A revised programme Cryptographic Enabling Services was created to reset the programme. The Review Note was taken by the Investment Approval Committee on 24 June 2014 and approved. The approved work programme is an initial Concept Phase for Cryptographic Enabling Services to address the immediate cryptographic capability gaps.
