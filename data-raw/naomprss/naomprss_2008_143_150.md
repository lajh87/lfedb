# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Terrier is Designed to be a Highly Mobile, Robust and Reliable Armoured Earthmoving Vehicle, which will Support Mobility, Counter Mobility and Survivability Throughout the Spectrum of Conflict. It will be Optimised for Battlefield Preparation and Used by Close Support Engineer Units. Terrier is Being Procured to Replace the Capability Provided by the Combat Engineer Tractors. the Programme Was Let under Competitive Tender and is Currently in Its Demonstration Phase. the Prototype Vehicle Has Effectively Completed Its Trials Programme. Four Demonstrator Vehicles Have Been Built and are Commencing Design Proving and Reliability Improvement Trials. Two Key User Requirements for Protection (KUR 07 and 08) Have Been Formally Demonstrated and Accepted, and Climatic Trails Have Been Completed. the Programme Has Been Adversely Affected by Delays in the Construction of the Demonstrator Vehicles and Slower than Expected Reliability Improvement on the Prototype Vehicle. as a Result BAE Systems Land Systems Has Missed the Release for Production Date and is in Default of the Contract. in Accordance with the Terms of the Contract BAE Systems Has Submitted a Rectification Plan for the Programme which is Currently Being Reviewed by the Investment Approvals Board. the Revised Programme Requires Significant Extra Time to Improve the Vehicle Reliability from Its Lower than Expected Start Point and the Consequences of this are Reflected in this Report. Release for Production (Milestone 12) Remains the Next Key Event and is Now Planned in the Second Quarter of 2008.

## 3e. Operational Impact of ISD Variation

Terrier will Provide a Highly Agile, Robust Earthmoving Capability which will Have Utility Across the Continuum of Operations from Warfighting to Peace Support. Terrier Replaces the Combat Engineer Tractor which is Being Removed from Service in March 2008 Despite Further Delays to the Terrier Programme. Restrictions on the Combat Engineer Tractor, Primarily Due to Bowman System Safety Concerns, Reliability and Industrial Obsolescence Had, in Effect, Already Initiated a Capability Gap as Combat Engineer Tractor is not Deployed on Current Operations. the Subsequent Delay to Terrier’s ISD Extends the Capability Gap and Removes Contingent Capability Manoeuvre Support until 2011. the 27 Month Delay to Terrier’s ISD Could be Partially Mitigated by Accepting a Lower Level of Reliability; However, this Compromise Would Increase the Platform’s Through Life Costs and Its Logistic Support Requirements. Trading Terrier’s Reliability Requirements Would also Decrease Its Operational Availability. the User Acknowledges the Operational Risk of the ISD Variation and Accepts the Delay to the Terrier Programme. However, the Expressed

Customer Preference is that Terrier’s Reliability Requirements are not Compromised. the Delayed ISD will Still Deliver Sufficient Terrier to Support a Medium Scale Contingent Operation by 2012 in Accordance with Extant Defence Policy.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

A Funded Feasibility Study for Terrier Concluded that the Most Cost-Effective Way of Meeting the Requirement Was to Develop a New Vehicle, where Possible Integrating in-Service Sub-Systems and Commercial Off-the-Shelf Equipment. Approval Was Given for a Competitive Project Definition Phase in August 1998 and Firm Price Contracts Were Placed in August 1999 with BAE Systems (with the Work Undertaken by Its Subsidiary Royal Ordnance Plc) and Vickers Defence Systems. Both Contractors Developed Detailed Designs Making Extensive Use of Computer Aided Design Tools, Virtual Reality Modelling, Rigs and Trials. the Capabilities Required and Constraints Imposed by Physical Limitations, Such as Rail and Air Transportability, Resulted in Very Similar Technical Solutions. Both Contractors Offered Tracked Vehicles Close in Size Weight and Mobility to the Warrior Tracked Infantry Fighting Vehicle, Having a Crew of Two and Providing Protection Against Small Arms, High Explosive Fragments and Mines. an Invitation to Tender Was Issued in February 2001 to both Companies which Sought Detailed Proposals and Prices for all Later Phases. the Invitation to Tender also Adopted Smart Acquisition Initiatives Such as Progressive Acceptance and Innovative Contractor Logistic Support Proposals. the Main Gate Business Case Was Approved on 17 July 2002. the Contract for Demonstration, Manufacture and Phase 1 Contractor Logistic Support Was Placed with Royal Ordnance Plc on 19 July 2002.
