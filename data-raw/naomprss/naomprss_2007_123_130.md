# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Sting Ray Lightweight Torpedo is the Main Anti-Submarine Weapon for Ships and Aircraft. It Entered Operational Service in 1983 with a Planned Service-Life of Around 20 Years. to Provide an Opportunity for International Collaboration on a Replacement, Sting Ray will Remain in-Service until Around 2025 when it is Envisaged that Other Nations will Require Replacement Lightweight Torpedoes. Accordingly the Sting Ray Torpedo Needed to be Life-Extended and Its Capability Enhanced.

The Sting Ray Life Extension (SRLE) Programme Was Approved in May 1995 and a Contract for Full Development Was Awarded to GEC-Marconi Underwater Systems (Now BAE Systems Electronics Ltd) on 10^th^ July 1996. the Design is Complete and the Certificate of Design Has Been Signed Off by the Authority. Following Approval for the SRLE Manufacturing Phase, a Contract Was Awarded to BAE Systems on 30^th^
January 2003.

In February 2001, as a Result of a Study into a less Sensitive Warhead for the Life–extended Sting Ray, a New Insensitive Munition Warhead Was Included in the SRLE Programme to Comply with New Departmental Safety Policy. This Programme Has Since Been Deferred and will Now be Reported as a Separate Programme.

The Production Qualification Trials Were Completed in December 2005 and the First Torpedo Was Delivered in February 2006. Delivery of the ISD Quantity of Torpedoes Was Achieved in June 2006.

Future Milestone: Production Acceptance Trial 3 Sentencing to Complete in January 2008.

3e Operational Impact of ISD Variation

The ISD Delay Has Enabled Additional Requirements to be Incorporated into the Weapon. However, the Delay Has the Potential to Cause a Capability Gap with the Older and less Effective Sting Ray Weapon Being Retained in Service with Ongoing Consequences for Reliability. This Capability Gap Should not be Critical.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Equivalent of the Assessment Phase Occurred Within a Number of Definition Studies Undertaken Between 1993 and 1995 under Sting Ray Design Services at a Cost of £2.6m. These Studies Considered Six Options which Formed Part of the Dossier Submitted to the Equipment Approvals Committee for Full Development and Pre Production (FDPP) Approval. Technical, Engineering and Environmental Specifications Together with FDPP, Production and in-Service Support Cost Plans Were also Produced.
