# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Type 45 is a new class of six Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers, to replace the capability provided by the

Royal Navy’s existing Type 42s. The warship is being procured nationally. The Type 45 will carry the Principal Anti-Air Missile System which is capable of protecting the vessels and ships in their company against aircraft and missiles, satisfying the Fleet’s need for area air defence capability into the 2030s. The

Principal Anti-Air Missile System is being procured collaboratively with France and Italy. The Destroyers Directorate is responsible for providing the Principal Anti-Air Missile System to the warship Prime Contractor.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The Type 45 Destroyer programme builds on the assessment work carried out in phase one of the collaborative Horizon project, the warship element of the Common New Generation Frigate programme. Following the decision of the three Horizon partners (France, Italy and the United Kingdom) to proceed with the Principal Anti-Air Missile System, but to pursue national warship programmes, BAE Systems was appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999. The contract for the Principal Anti-Air Missile System Full Scale Engineering Development and Initial Production was placed in August 1999. Main Gate approval for the warship was achieved in July 2000 and a contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture was placed in December 2000.

## A.3. Progress

BAE Systems Electronics was appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999 and a contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture for the first three ships was placed in December 2000. A contract for a further three Type 45 hulls was placed with the Prime Contractor in February 2002. The ships are being built under sub-contract by BVT Surface Fleet Ltd (a joint venture company formed in 2008 between BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and Vosper Thorneycroft Shipbuilding). The Demonstration & Manufacture contract was amended to reflect the Investment Approvals Board Six-Ship Approval gained in August 2007. This change has introduced a staged acceptance process for each ship which commences with Acceptance off Contract, thereby giving control of the vessel to the MOD to undertake a further period of trials and acceptance activity leading to the declaration of In-Service Date.

The past year has seen significant progress in the manufacture of the six ships. All ships are now in production. The fourth ship (Dragon) was launched in November 2008. The second ship (Dauntless) completed her first set of Sea Trials in December 2008. The First of Class (Daring) was Accepted off Contract from the Prime Contractor in December 2008. Successful test firings of the Principal Anti-Air Missile System took place in June 2008 and February 2009.

It was announced in June that as part of the Department’s 2008 Planning Round the decision was taken not to take up the option to proceed with Type 45 Ships 7 and 8.

## A.4. Capability Risks

In order for a force of ships to operate safely at sea and project power onto the land, it has to reduce its susceptibility to attack from the air. The current generation of anti-air warfare capability (Type 42 Destroyer) has already been extended beyond its design life and is now rapidly approaching its Out of Service Date. The Type 45 Destroyer will ensure that UK maritime forces retain a sufficiently robust capability to counter the growing threat from the air for the next 25 years. Without the Type 45, the UK would be severely limited in its ability to operate maritime forces in all but the most benign environments. There would also be a significant shortfall in the number of ships available to deploy world-wide in support of wider British interests, fulfilling roles from defence diplomacy to disaster relief to crisis intervention.

There are three broad layers to Type 45 Destroyer support:

<li>Interim Support covers the period from the First of Class (Daring) Acceptance off Contract to ISD. The change to ship acceptance approved as part of wider programme re-approval in August 2007 advances</li>

the date that the First of Class is accepted off contract, consequently requiring interim support arrangements to be put in place until ISD. Funding for Interim Support was approved under the Six Ship Approval and costs are reported against the Demonstration &amp; Manufacture phase costs for Type 45, hence this element is not reported further within the Support section. Interim support arrangements could be extended to mitigate any delay in the delivery of Full Support, but at a potential cost increase of £1 million per ship per month.

<li>Type 45 Initial Industrial Investment and Long Lead Spares. Purchase of long-lead spares and industrial mobilisation activities for which contracts need to be placed ahead of the Type 45 Full Support Solution (see c. below) in order to be available for ISD.

<li>Full Support.

Following this initial support period, Type 45 support is expected to migrate to the Surface Ship Support Programme, and support for the Principal Anti-Air Missile System to a wider Team Complex Weapons commercial arrangement. Confirmation of Main Gate Business Case Approval for the Full Support solution was only received 13 March 2009, hence this element is not reported further within the Support section.
