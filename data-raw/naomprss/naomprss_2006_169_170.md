Integrated Project Team Responsible

FUTURE STRATEGIC TANKER AIRCRAFT

Single Point of Accountability for project capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Expeditionary Logistics & Support)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) is planned to replace the air refuelling (AR) and some elements of air transport (AT) capability currently provided by the Royal Air Force’s fleet of VC10 and TriStar aircraft. AR is a key military capability that provides force multiplication and operational range enhancement for front line aircraft across a range of Defence roles and military tasks.

# SECTION 2: THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

Note: Actual in service dates and costs are not set until projects reach the point in time when the main investment decision is made ie Main Gate approval. Until this point all costs and dates are outline assumptions solely for internal planning purposes.

## 2a. Description of the Assessment Phase

FSTA was nominated as a potential Private Finance Initiative (PFI) project in 1997. An Assessment Phase, designed to confirm whether PFI would offer best value for money, was launched following Initial Gate approval in December 2000.

The Assessment Phase is intended to confirm industry’s ability to meet the service requirement, programme timescales and costs. It is also required to determine whether the inclusion of Air Transport capability in the contract will represent value for money, and clarify the manning and personnel implications.

<td colspan="3">After a competition and several years of complex PFI negotiations AirTanker Ltd, a consortium comprising EADS, Rolls Royce, Cobham, and Thales were judged to offer the best prospective PFI solution. VT Group joined the consortium shortly after. Following subsequent resolution of key commercial terms, Secretary of State announced on 28 February 2005 that AirTanker Ltd had been selected as Preferred Bidder for FSTA. A final decision on the PFI deal for the FSTA programme can be made only when negotiations are complete, the detailed contract is agreed, and the risks to the programme are fully understood. While the MOD, in consultation with the rest of Government, hopes to complete its assessment soon, further progress has to be made with AirTanker towards agreeing a fully developed contract covering all the commercial terms and service provision aspects. This has led to a further extension, and increase in investment to the Assessment Phase in order to further de-risk the Main Gate Business Case.</td>
