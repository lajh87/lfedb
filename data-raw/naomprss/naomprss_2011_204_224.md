# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Typhoon

Typhoon, Formerly Known as Eurofighter, is an Agile Multi-Role Combat Aircraft. Originally Designed Primarily, but not Exclusively, for Air Superiority the Aircraft is also Capable of Delivering a Precision Ground Attack Capability. Typhoon Has the Flexibility to Respond to the Uncertain Demands of the Current and Evolving Strategic Environment.

The Aircraft is Being Developed, Produced and Supported in a Collaborative Project with Germany, Italy and

Spain. the Project is Managed on Behalf of the Four Partner Nations by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency. to Date, Contracts Have Been Placed for the RAF to Receive 160 Aircraft in Three Tranches. Typhoon Support is Being Delivered Through the Letting of Long-Term Contracts Against Five Areas of Support.

Typhoon Future Capability Programme

The Typhoon Future Capability Programme will Provide Enhancements to the Typhoon Aircraft, both in the Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface Roles, to Sustain the RAF’s Typhoon Fleet’s Multi-Role Capabilities.

The First Phase of the Future Capability Programme, under a Contract Signed in March 2007, will Integrate Paveway IV and the Litening III Laser Designator Pod Onto Tranche 2 Aircraft from 2012 as Well as Interoperability Upgrades without which Those Aircraft will be Neither Compliant with New Civil Airspace Regulations nor Interoperable with Key Coalition Allies. It will also Provide the Human Machine Interface for Multi-Role Operations, Allowing Typhoon to Fulfil Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface Operations with the Current, Planned and Projected Weapons.

The Department will Continue to Develop the Typhoon Capability Incrementally in Line with the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Typhoon

Pre-Development, which Commenced with the Approval of the Feasibility Study in 1984, Comprised a Number of Activities. Following Early Concept Studies, and Various Efforts at Establishing a Collaborative Programme, There Were Two Key Typhoon Demonstration Activities Completed by the UK Before Development: The Experimental Aircraft Programme, an Airframe Programme Primarily Aimed at Proving the Feasibility of the Typhoon Unstable Flight Control Concepts, and the XG40 Engine Demonstrator Programme at Rolls Royce. the Results of These Demonstrators and their Associated Studies, Together with the Results of Similar Work Within the Other Nations Were Harmonised in a Definition, Refinement and Risk Reduction Phase that Ran from the End of 1985 when Four Nations Signed the Initial Memorandum of Understanding, until 1988 when the Development Contract Was Signed.

Typhoon Future Capability Programme

The Approval Process for Typhoon Tranche 2 Noted the Intention to Develop the Capability of the Aircraft Through Life and Envisaged an Incremental Route to the Acquisition of Future Capability Enhancements. the Assessment Phase Found Technology and Integration Were not a Major Challenge and that Risks Mostly Pertained to the Commercial and Industrial Aspects of the Programme. These Have Been Addressed and the MOD Approvals Process for the Project Was Accelerated to Combine Initial Gate, Including the Cost Already Incurred During the Assessment Phase, and Main Gate in Order to Maximise Efficiency Across the Four Partner Nations.

## A.3. Progress

Typhoon Has Been in Service with the RAF Since 2003 and Commenced Operational Duties for the First Time in June 2007 when it Assumed Quick Reaction Alert Responsibility for Defence of UK Airspace. Deployable Air Defence Operational Status Was Achieved on 1 January 2008, which Enables Typhoon to Deploy Worldwide on Air-to-Air Missions. Typhoon Was Declared to NATO in the Deployable Air Defence –
Advanced Role on 1 April 2008. Typhoon Assumed Quick Reaction Alert Responsibility for Defence of South Atlantic Islands Airspace in September 2009, Taking over from Tornado F3.

The Existing Advanced Air-to-Air Missile Capability on Tranche 1 Aircraft Has Been Complemented by the Integration of an Initial Precision Air-to-Surface Capability, which Was Declared Combat Ready by the RAF in July 2008. This Air-to-Surface Capability Enabled Declaration of Multi-Role Status and is in Advance of more Comprehensive Air-to-Surface Capability Through the Typhoon Future Capability Programme for Tranche 2 Aircraft.

Deliveries of Tranche 2 Aircraft Commenced in October 2008. the Original Typhoon Fleet Numbers Required (232 Aircraft) Were Established in the 1990s. Current Fleet Planning and Assumptions to Meet Defence Requirements Have Determined the Aircraft Numbers and Capabilities Required Now (160 Aircraft). the Contract for the Third Tranche, Signed in July 2009, Represents the Best Solution for the UK in Balancing Current Military Requirement and International Obligations Against Affordability. the UK Has Retained the Option to Order Further Aircraft. Deliveries of Tranche 3 Aircraft are Scheduled to Start in 2013.

The Typhoon Availability Service Contract with BAE Systems, Signed in March 2009 Formally Commenced in September 2009. the Engine Availability Service Contract with Rolls-Royce Was Signed in December 2009. These Contracts are Part of the Strategy to Transform Support Arrangements Through Partnering with UK Industry.

Number 6 Squadron, the First Typhoon Fighter Squadron in Scotland, Officially Formed at RAF Leuchars on 6 September 2010. the Typhoon Force Assumed Quick Reaction Alert (North) Air Defence Responsibility from RAF Leuchars in March 2011.

In March 2011, Typhoon Aircraft Were Deployed Overseas for the First Time on Contingent Operations in Support of the Coalition Plan to Enforce United Nations Resolution 1973 (Libya).

## A.4. Capability Risks

Typhoon is Intended to be a Cornerstone of UK Air Defence and the Aircraft will be Pivotal to the Delivery of Standing Home Commitments. Having Replaced Jaguar in the Ground Attack Role and with Future Reductions in Other Aircraft Types Occurring, Loss of Typhoon Would Reduce the UK's Ground-Attack and Air Superiority Capabilities.

Typhoon's Partnered Support Strategy Was Originally Approved in 2000. Its Principles Were Reinforced by the Results of a 2004 Support Review. the Partnered Support Strategy - Referred to as Typhoon Future Support - will be Delivered Through the Letting of Long-Term Contracts Against Five Areas of Support: For the Typhoon Availability Service on BAE Systems; for the Propulsion Availability Service on Rolls Royce; for Avionics (Spares Provisioning and Component Repair) via the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency; and for International Technical Support Services, also via the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency. Valuable Experience Has Already Been Gained Through the Letting of Incremental Contracts to Transform Typhoon Support, the First of which Was the Initial Phase of the Engine Availability Contract with Rolls Royce in 2005.
