Director of Equipment Capability (Above Water Effect)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Type 45 is a New Class of Eight[^1] Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers, to Replace the Capability Provided by the Royal Navy’s Existing Type 42s. the Warship is Being Procured Nationally. the Type 45 will Carry the Principal Anti-Air Missile System which is Capable of Protecting the Vessels and Ships in their Company Against Aircraft and Missiles, Satisfying the Fleet’s Need for Area Air Defence Capability into the 2030s. the Principal Anti-Air Missile System is Being Procured Collaboratively with France and Italy. the Type 45 Integrated Project Team is Responsible for Providing the Principal Anti-Air Missile System to the Warship Prime Contractor.

BAE Systems Electronics Was Appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999 and a Contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture for the First Three Ships Was Placed in December 2000. a Contract for a Further Three Type 45 Hulls Was Placed with the Prime Contractor in February 2002. the Ships are Being Built under Sub-Contract by BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Shipbuilding.

The BAE Systems Contract Has Now Been Amended to Reflect the Investment Approvals Board Six-Ship Approval Gained in August 2007. This Change Has Introduced a Staged Acceptance Process for Each Ship which Commences with Acceptance Off Contract, Thereby Giving Control of the Vessel to the MoD to Undertake a Further Period of Trials and Acceptance Activity Leading to the Declaration of in-Service Date.

The Past Year Has Seen Significant Progress in the Manufacture of the Six Ships. All Ships are Now in Production Following the Cutting of Steel for the Sixth Ship in January 2007. the Third Ship (HMS Diamond) Was Launched November 2007 and the Fourth Ship (HMS Dragon) is Scheduled for Launch in November 2008. the First of Class (HMS Daring) Has Successfully Completed Sea Trials in August 2007, with Further Sea Trials Planned in April 2008. HMS Daring Acceptance Off Contract is Targeted for December 2008, with an Approved in-Service Date of November 2010. 1b. Associated Projects

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Type 45 Destroyer Programme Builds on the Assessment Work Carried Out in Phase 1 of the Collaborative HORIZON Project, the Warship Element of the Common New Generation Frigate Programme. Following the Decision of the Three HORIZON Partners (France, Italy and the United Kingdom) to Proceed with Principal Anti-Air Missile System, but to Pursue National Warship Programmes, BAE Systems Was Appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999. the Contract for Principal Anti-Air Missile System Full Scale Engineering Development and Initial Production Was Placed in August 1999. Main Gate Approval for the Warship Was Achieved in July 2000 and a Contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture Was Placed in December 2000.
