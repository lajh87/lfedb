# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Requirement for an Airborne Surveillance and Control Capability Emerged from the Need to Provide an Organic, Long-Range Airborne Surveillance, Control and Early Warning Capability to Carrier Enabled Power Projection, Littoral Manoeuvre, and Maritime Task Groups at all Scales of Operation. the CROWSNEST Project is to Succeed the Capability Currently Provided by the Sea King Mk7 Airborne Surveillance & Control Aircraft, which Has a Planned Out of Service Date of September 2018, Extended from 31 March 2016. the Primary Purpose of this Capability is to Provide Organic Force Protection for Maritime Task Groups and their Forward Deployed Task Elements, Including Wide-Area Surveillance Overland and in the Littoral Environment. Following the 2010 Strategic Defence & Security Review, the CROWSNEST Capability is Required to be Delivered as a Role-Fit Mission System Integrated into the Merlin Mk2 Helicopter. the CROWSNEST Project will Procure 10 Role-Fit Mission Systems, and Convert all 30 x Merlin Mk2 Aircraft to Make Them
‘fit-to-Receive’ the CROWSNEST Role-Fit Equipment.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

The CROWSNEST Assessment Phase is Planned to Run from March 2013 Through to a Main Gate Investment Decision in April 2016, at an Expected Cost of
£43m. the Purpose of the Assessment Phase is to Select a Mission System Supplier from Two Competing Solutions, One Provided by Lockheed Martin UK, and One Provided by Thales UK. the Assessment Phase Competition is Being Managed by Lockheed Martin UK in their Role as the Merlin Mk2 Design Organization, and Appropriate ‘firewall Procedures’ and MOD Oversight Have Been Established to Ensure that Lockheed Martin Run an Open and Fair Competition in which They are also Competing. Down Selection to the Winning Mission System Supplier is Expected in Spring 2015.

## A.3. Project History Up to 31 March 2014

The 2010 Strategic Defence & Security Review Directed that the UK’s Future Maritime Airborne Surveillance & Control Capability Was to be Provided via Role-Fit Equipment for Installation on the Merlin Mk2 under the Maritime Force Protection Optimization Planning Round 2011 Option. Review Note Approval to Commence the Project Was Obtained in March 2013, with a Planned in-Service Date of April 2020, and a £3m Limit of Liability Initial Phase of the Assessment Phase Commenced in March 2013.

The Initial Phase of the CROWSNEST Assessment Phase Was the Subject of a Helicopters Operating Centre Senior Management Review in Defence Equipment and Support, Confirmed that the Project Should Proceed into the Full Phase of the Assessment Phase. in Parallel, Work Conducted by Navy Command and Defence Equipment and Support Identified an Opportunity to Accelerate the Project by 18 Months, for a Revised in-Service Date of October 2018. This Accelerated Programme Was Adopted in Autumn 2013, and the Full Phase Contract Award with Lockheed Martin Was Placed in September 2013. in February 2014 Each Competing Mission System Supplier Held Successful Initial Design Reviews.

## A.4. in-Year Progress

During the Year both Mission System Suppliers Further Matured their Design Solutions and Conducted Derisking Activities by Undertaking the Following Activities:

-   Flight Trials: Lockheed Martin Trialled 2 x Prototype Radar Pods, One on Each Side of the Aircraft, to Demonstrate Radar Performance and the Ability to Deliver Full 360° Surveillance; Meanwhile, Thales Trialled a Prototype Radar Deployment Mechanism to Demonstrate the Ability to Lower and Raise the Radar.

-   Capability Performance: both Mission System Suppliers Constructed a Mission System Synthetic Environment to Allow a Competitive
‘fly-Off’ of the 2 Systems using 2 Operators Manning a Prototype Mission Console to Conduct Real-Time Operation of the System Against Representative Military Scenarios.

-   Design Maturation: both Mission System Suppliers Conducted Further Design Reviews in June/July and November 2014, Leading to Design Freezes in December 2014 in Advance of Proposal Submission.

Proposals Were Received from both Mission System Suppliers at End-January 2015, which Have Been Evaluated by the Combined Prime Contractor and MOD Assessment Team, and an Announcement of the Preferred Bidder is Anticipated in Spring 2015.

During the Year the Forecast Cost of the Assessment Phase Has Increased from £34m to the Approval Value of £43m to Allow De-Risking Activity Ahead of the Main Gate Decision and to Continue with the Preferred Supplier in Order to Maintain the Schedule to the Projected ISD of October 2018

1.  Capability Risks

The Requirement is Driven by the Need to Provide Force Protection of the Carrier Enabled Power Projection, Littoral Manoeuvre and Maritime Task Groups, Including Forward-Deployed Force Elements. the Procurement of the CROWSNEST Capability Mitigates Other ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Targeting, Acquisition and Reconnaissance) Capability Gaps by Providing an Assured Surveillance Capability to Detect Inbound Threats. Without this Capability the Task Group Would Have Reduced Situational Awareness of Air and Surface Threats at Range, and Thus Have Reduced Warning Time to Counter any Inbound Threats.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Merlin Mk2 Support Currently is Provided Through the Integrated Merlin Operational Support Contract with AgustaWestland as Prime Contractor in Concert with Other Key Industry Partners Such as Lockheed Martin, Selex, and Thales. It is Intended that CROWSNEST Support will be Added to this Support Arrangement for Pricing Period 4, which is Scheduled to Commence in April 2020. Prior to This, Lockheed Martin will be Responsible for Providing the Initial in-Service Support under the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase Prime Contract. |
