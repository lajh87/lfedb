PUMA LIFE EXTENSION PROGRAMME

# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

Puma currently provides one third of the Department's medium support helicopter fleet. The Out of Service Date for the Puma HC MK1 Helicopter fleet is December 2012, driven by the obsolescence of components, safety issues and changed legislative requirements. The life extension programme will address these issues by the installation of a glass cockpit, modern avionics, including a digital automatic flight control system and new engines addressing obsolescence and safety issues and delivering a step-change in performance, particularly in hot and high environments (such as those seen in Afghanistan) and high and dusty conditions. It is also the only helicopter in our current fleets which allows Special Forces insertion/extraction in urban environments such as operations in Baghdad and potential support to the 2012 Olympics. The life extended platform will be known as the Puma HC MK2 and sustain this capability up to 2025.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Assessment Phase ran from February 2007 to June 2009 with a total investment of £16.169M VAT Inclusive. This included a period from October 2008 to June 2009, known as Assessment Phase Plus with an approved cost of £9.969M VAT Inclusive, which focussed on risk reduction activity ahead of Main Gate to maintain alignment of the Puma HC MK2 programme with the Puma HC Mk1 Out of Service Date.

A Main Gate approval case for the Puma HC Mk 2 Support Solution will be submitted separately.

<th>The programme remains on track and within budget. The delivery of the first Aircraft into the Programme to become the Trial Installation Aircraft took place on 1st October 2009. The Ground Testing 'Power On'
of the Trial Installation Aircraft started on 24th September 2010. The first production aircraft , fourth into the programme, was delivered to Brasov, Romania, on the 14th January 2011. Future Milestones:
The flight clearance of the Trial Installation Aircraft will be completed by 29th April 2011 to allow the first flight of the Puma HC Mk2 to take place. This will be followed by the issue of Letter of Qualification for the Puma HC Mk2 by th 30th November 2011 and delivery of the Trial Installation Aircraft to Boscombe Down is contracted for January 2012. As part of the Department's 2011 Planning Round an Option was taken to reduce the number of aircraft within the Programme from 28 to 24.</th>

# A.4 Capability Risks

All elements of the UK Helicopter lift are planned to undergo significant modifications during the next decade to sustain their capability contribution. The first step is the update of the Puma capability. The Puma HC MK2 will then sustain operations and provide contingent capability to relieve where necessary: Sea King Mk4 and Merlin MK3/3a. The Puma HC MK2 provides constancy from 2012 and any slippage in its introduction will generate operational pressure during subsequent upgrades and transitions.

The Puma HC Mk2 Helicopter Future Support Arrangements: Intial Gate Business Case approved the support solution Assessment Phase, at a value of £4.8M, to evaluate and down select the support Options for the aircraft. The assessment phase contract has been placed, single source, with Eurocopter (UK). The Support Strategy options for Puma HC MK2 are:
Traditional existing approach inclusive of an existing Eurocopter Through Life Support activity for specific equipments; Enhanced Through Life Support approach with scope of equipments being increased, and additional contractor support elements; and an Integrated Operational Support solution. The Main Gate Businiess Case submission is currently planned for quarter 1 in 2012 leading to a estimated contract placement of quarter 3 in 2012. Review notes are also required for Initial Provisioning of Long Lead Items and Interim Support arrangements.
