Senior Responsible Owner for Broader Capability:

Capability Manager Precision Attack

# SECTION 1: ABOUT the REQUIREMENT

The MOD Requires an Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT) for Pre-Operational Training of Fast-Jet Aircrew. This Task is Currently Fulfilled by the Hawk TMk1 Aircraft, which will Need to be Replaced in the Flying Training Role from 2010 Onwards. the Full Range of Skills Required for Aircrew to Fly Front-Line Aircraft Cannot Now be Gained using the Current Advanced Jet Trainer, so more Training on Operational Aircraft Has to be Undertaken. the Introduction of Typhoon and the Future Joint Combat Aircraft Exacerbates this Training Gap Such that the Required Standard for Typhoon Aircrew is not Achievable with Hawk

TMk1.

The AJT is the Fast Jet Element of the Wider United Kingdom Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) Programme and will Deliver Capabilities Including: a Modern Glass Cockpit Environment, an Avionics Suite Compliant with Latest Airspace Legislation, an Embedded Training System that Simulates Front-Line Sensors and Weapons and a Flexible and Upgradeable Mission System. Support, Infrastructure and a Ground Based Training Environment will also be Provided. AJT will be Contracted for in Such a Way as to Ensure that it can be Subsumed Within the Main UKMFTS Contract at a Later Date.

Initial Planning Was for 20 Aircraft with Options Up to a Total of 44. the Current Plan Assumes a Baseline Capability Requirement of 28 Aircraft.

# SECTION 2: THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

Note: Actual in Service Dates and Costs are not Set until Projects Reach the Point in Time when the Main Investment Decision is Made i.e. Main Gate Approval. Until this Point, all Costs and Dates are Outline Assumptions Solely for Internal Planning Purposes. 2a. Description of the Assessment Phase

At Initial Gate (December 2002) AJT Was a Component of UKMFTS. Within the £39m Approved for

UKMFTS Assessment, £2m Related to AJT and a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) Approach Was Assumed. in July 2003 a Ministerial Direction Was Given to Conventionally Procure Hawk 128 from BAE Systems. in December 2003 a £31m Risk Reduction Contract (RRC) Was Placed with BAE Systems to Cover Risk Reduction Activities to October 2003.

In November 2004, Approval Was Given for a Combined Assessment &
Development Phase Based on an Incremental Approach at a not to Exceed Price of £196m and a not to Exceed Completion Date of August 2008; the Assessment Phase Element of this Approval Was Around £75m. a Design and Development Contract Was Let to BAE Systems in December 2004. Main Gate Approval is Expected Later this Year. This Approval will Set the Aircraft Build Standard, Definition of in-Service Date, Key System Requirements and Aircraft Numbers.
