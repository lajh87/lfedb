• Support/Service/PFI - Interim Support Arrangement

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Interim Support Arrangement is a precursor to the Future Support Arrangement. From first delivery in 2000, the growing Apache fleet was initially supported by Contractor Logistic Support on separate contracts with AgustaWestland. These separate contracts were extended to 2007, in anticipation of the Future Support Arrangement start date. However the Future Support Arrangement has been delayed due to extended commercial and financial discussions. Crucial in the case for the Interim Support

Arrangement was that it did not conflict with the intent and strategy for the Future Support Arrangement, and the Interim Support Arrangement contract had the ability to accommodate the Future Support Arrangement if needed.

Interim Support Arrangement covers the following Apache Army Helicopter Mark 1 In Service Support areas from April 2007, until the Future Support Arrangement is in place:

Material Flow – Repair and supply chain management.

Aircraft Availability – Depth Support Maintenance and Forward Support to the training fleet.

Technical Support Services – Post Design Services.

Management Services – management services in respect of the contract with clauses to enable Project Team transformation and development of a Value for Money Benchmark for the Future Support Arrangement.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

There was no formal Assessment Phase for the Interim Support Arrangement, however it was subjected to a Business Case and Investment Appraisal.

## A.3. Progress

The Interim Support Arrangement was first notified by Information Note to the Investment Approvals Board in August 2006.

The Interim Support Arrangement Investment Appraisal and Business Case were submitted for scrutiny to the Defence Logistic Investment Board in January 2007.

The Defence Logistics Investment Board of February 2007 approved Interim Support Arrangement for a three year contract at a Not To Exceed cost of
£237m consisting entirely of Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit at 50% confidence.

The Investment Approvals Board was notified of the Interim Support Arrangement in February 2007. Contract Award was made on 28 March 2007 for 01 April 2007 start. The Interim Support Arrangement is structured to fully meet obligations in the Customer Supplier Agreement (now Joint Business Agreement), which includes supporting Operations, and facilitates progress towards the Future Support Arrangement.

Claims for In-Service Support against the Conflict Prevention Fund for the Apache Attack Helicopter have been less than £3m to date.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Apache Attack Helicopter capability could not be sustained without the provision of in service support. Without the Interim Support Arrangement, aircraft availability and flying rates would drop to zero very quickly. The Interim Support Arrangement provides support required in order that the Apache can fulfil its operational mission. If the Interim Support Arrangement was withdrawn, an alternative support solution would have to be put in place, possibly at increased cost.

Apache Army Helicopter Mark 1 was procured through a United Kingdom Prime Contractor, AgustaWestland, with Tier 1 United States of America equipment manufacturers for the Airframe (Boeing), Sensors (Lockheed Martin Overseas Company) and Fire Control Radar (LongBow International). Other major United Kingdom equipment manufacturers provided the Engines (Rolls Royce), Transmissions (Westland Transmissions Limited) and Helicopter Integrated Defensive Aid Suite (Selex). Munitions were procured through Lockheed Martin Insys and a separate Public Finance Initiative contract by Aviation Training International Limited provided the Training Service, which runs for 30 years with a break point at 2017 to allow the contract to be renegotiated. Original equipment manufacturers are now the suppliers to the Prime Contractor for In Service Support covered by the Interim Support Arrangement, providing:
