# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Future Integrated Soldier Technology Programme Aims to Integrate both Current and Emerging Key Technologies that British Dismounted Soldiers Require for Them to Maintain their Position in the Forefront of Capability. the Programme will Ensure the Future Soldier Has Equipment that Optimises Effectiveness, Reduces Physical and Psychological Load, and Minimises the Effects of Combat Stress and the Risks of Human Error.

Historically, Soldiers Have Been Equipped in a Piecemeal Manner. the Programme will Consider the Dismounted Soldier as a System, and the Eight-Man Section as a Virtual Platform. This ‘system of Systems’
Approach, Demonstrated Successfully During the Concept Phase, will Fundamentally Improve the Capabilities of Troops Engaged in Dismounted Close Combat. It will Deliver an Integrated Suite of Equipment Encompassing the NATO Domains of Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information, Lethality, Mobility, Survivability and Sustainability.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Initial Gate Approval Was Achieved in August 2001. Four Companies Submitted Tenders for the Assessment Phase Prime Contract, Two of Whom Were Selected to Take Part in a Competitive Planning Phase Starting in August 2002. the Selection of Thales UK Ltd as the Assessment Phase Prime Contractor Was Announced on 12 March 2003.

1.  Number of Factors Caused the Duration of the Assessment Phase to be Extended. Critical Trials Planned for Summer 2004 Were Delayed by Three Months Due to Commitment of Troops to Operations Overseas. Problems Were Encountered on a Subsequent Major Trial Held in Autumn 2005, as some Systems Proved to be Short of the Required Levels of Technical Readiness and Insufficiently Robust to Allow Adequate Data to be Collected to Inform the Main Gate Business Case. Consequently, more Time Was Needed to Mature Understanding of the Requirement and of the Final Technical Solution. Successful Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisal Trials Followed and Produced the Required Data. at the Start of

2007/08 Work on the Main Programme Was Suspended for Five Months (Although the Impact on the Date of Main Gate Was not Commensurate) to Allow Thales to Deliver Two Urgent Operational Requirements using Technology Arising Out of Future Integrated Soldier Technology, which will Provide an Early Benefit to Troops Engaged on Current Operations.

As a Consequence of the Problems Experienced on the Autumn 2005 Trials, a New Incremental Procurement Strategy Was Adopted, Allowing Technology to be Exploited as it Matures, Thereby De-Risking the Programme While not Losing Sight of the Aim of an Integrated Suite of Equipment. Each Increment will

Have Its Own Main Gate Approval, Preceded by an Assessment Phase, Meaning There is Now Considerably more Assessment Work Overall in Future Integrated Soldier Technology than Was Forecast when Only a Single Main Gate Was Envisaged. the First Increment is Divided into Two Parallel Elements, One Addressing the Area of Surveillance and Target Acquisition (Increment 1a), the Other Looking at Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information (Increment 1b). Further Increments are Anticipated but Have not yet Been Approved at Initial Gate. the Assessment Phase for the First Increment Includes Pre-Main Gate Competitions at Sub-System Level, the Results of which will be Reflected in the Main Gate Business Cases. Thales are Currently under Contract until 30 September 2009.

1.  Progress

Towards the End of 2008 both Elements of the First Increment Were Reprofiled, Partly in Response to Operational Demand for Increased Quantities of Surveillance and Target Acquisition Equipment, with the Result that the Main Gate Business Cases Have Been Amended and Revised Price Quotations Obtained from Thales and their Supply Chain. This Has Delayed Formal Submission of the Main Gate Business Cases.

Once Each Increment Has Been Approved at Main Gate, Detailed Contractual Arrangements will be Negotiated with the Prime Contractor, Who will then Undertake a Programme of Demonstration and Manufacture Resulting in the Delivery of Equipment. Work on the Assessment Phase of a Second Increment is Expected to Commence During 2010, Subject to Approval.

1.  Capability Risks

The Dismounted Close Combat Environment Requires that the Individual Infantry Soldier Contribute to a Fully Complementary, Flexible and Balanced Capability. the Future Integrated Soldier Technology Package will Permit the Dismounted Soldier to Conduct Core Functions, 24 Hours a Day, both Rapidly and Effectively, in Order to Defeat the Enemy with the Weapon Systems at His Disposal. the Assessment Phase Has Demonstrated that a Suite of Capabilities and Technologies is Required in Order to Fill the Identified Capability Gaps. Failure to Proceed Would Perpetuate the Capability Shortfall and the Associated Operational Risk, While also Failing to Provide a Long Term Solution to the Evolving Sophistication of the Threat to Those Personnel Engaged in Dismounted Close Combat. as a Consequence, Increased Risk Would be Incurred when Embarking on Future Operations Due to Defence Being Inadequately Prepared to Meet Emerging Threats. the Dismounted Soldier Would Therefore be Severely Disadvantaged Through this Unplanned Approach.
