The UK currently has a fleet of 46 Chinook, delivered between 1981 and 2001. Project New Buy:
The new Rotary Wing Strategy, announced by the Secretary of State in December 2009, established that the Future Heavy Lift capability would be provided by the Chinook helicopter. The Rotary Wing Strategy set out the intention to buy an additional 22 new Chinook, in addition to the replacement for the two aircraft destroyed on operations in Afghanistan in August 2009 (for which approval will be sought through the HM Treasury Reserve), that would take the Chinook fleet upto 70 aircraft. Operational Analysis has routinely identified the unique strength of capability provided by Chinook. The most recent Lift Advanced Concept Phase 3 analysis provides clear evidence of the need for a greater number of Chinook helicopters. However, Operational Analysis has not identified an obvious blend of helicopter types that is affordable, cost-effective, and which meets all our helicopter requirements. Chinook delivers more capability for a given investment than smaller types, and hence the earlier this rebalancing can occur, the faster overall UK helicopter capability can be increased. In Sept 2010 the Strategic Defence and Security Review reduced the requirement to 14 aircraft (12+ 2 attrition aircraft to replace those lost in Afghanistan in 2009). Project JULIUS:
An Urgent Operational Requirement was introduced in 2002 to enhance the operational capability of the Chinook during night-time operations in Iraq. The Night Enhancement Package was fitted to eight Chinook Mk2/2A aircraft, and was intended to fill a short-term gap until the introduction of the delayed Chinook Mk3 to provide heavy-lift helicopter capability specifically for Special Forces. In September 2004 a "Fix-to-Field" project for the eight Chinook Mk3 aircraft commenced. The proposed solution to meet the Special Forces requirement was to modify the cockpit display systems, together with integration of special operations equipment and a comprehensive Defensive Aids Suite. In June 2005, under the auspice of the Future Rotorcraft Capability programme, a Land Advanced Concept Phase was initiated to determine the most cost-effective and balanced fleet of future rotorcraft lift platforms. Subsequently, it was decided to adopt an incremental approval strategy; Increment 2

<sup>Enter Text Here</sup>presented options to address the balance of Special Forces heavy lift requirement. It was assumed that Fix-to-Field would still deliver eight Mk3 Special Forces aircraft.

In March 2007 the Fix-to-Field project was cancelled in favour of a project to revert the Chinook Mk3 aircraft to a standard similar as the Mk2/2A. The imperative was to make helicopters available for operations in Afghanistan as quickly as possible. The JULIUS project was therefore conceived to modify eight Chinook Mk2/2A aircraft and convert them from a Support Helicopter standard into a Special Forces variant, to be designated Mk4/4A. The main changes to the aircraft were to be the incorporation of an integrated glass cockpit, moving map tablet and a crewman’s workstation. The Joint Capabilities Board later decided to increase the flexibility of the current Chinook fleet by moving to fit all of the fleet with the JULIUS modification, to deliver a 48 aircraft coherent fleet, so that aircraft could more easily ‘swing role’ between Special Forces and Support Helicopter tasks, thus obviating the need to acquire the additional six aircraft for Special Forces that had been planned under Land Advanced Concept Phase Increment 2.

Project New Buy:
In March 2010 Initial Gate approval for the Chinook New Buy project was granted to conduct an Assessment Phase at a total cost of £67M (50% confidence). This funding approval assumed that a Main Gate Business Case would be presented in December 2010, and that a Demonstration and Manufacture contract would be placed shortly thereafter. In May 2010 the Investment Approvals Board endorsed a Review Note to down-select to a preferred configuration for the new Chinooks. The configuration selected was the CH-47F equipped with a development of the Thales JULIUS cockpit and a digital automatic flight control system and current UK Chinook Theatre Entry Standard modifications. In January 2011, subsequent to Strategic Defence and Security Review announcements, and the delay to a Main Gate decision for New Buy Chinook, a Review Note was submitted to the Investment Approvals Board seeking an uplift of £29M to the approval to sustain critical path activity and protect all delivery options to the end of May 2011. However, the Investment Approvals Board only approved an uplift of £6.5M to fund programme activity to the end of March 2011 and requested further advice in early March, assuming the Defence Board and Ministers had determined the way forward on Chinook in the context of the wider Planning Round. In April 2011 the Department's latest financial plan captured the Defence Board's direction to pursue a 14 Chinook aircraft programme that would see the first flight in Quarter one of 2013 and all aircraft delivered by end of 2015. HM Treasury approved an Investment Approvals Board uplift to the Assessment Phase of £23.4M. In July 2011 a further uplift of £47.1M, to extend the Assessment Phase to October 2011, was approved. However, subsequently HM Treasury approved the Main Gate Business Case on the 20th July 2011. Key milestones were approved as follows: Entry into Service of one aircraft delivered to the UK with an Interim Release to Service in May 2014; an Initial Operating Capability of three aircraft available for worldwide deployment in January 2015.

Project JULIUS: Enter Text Here

In November 2007 HMT declined to fund the modification programme from the Conflict Prevention Fund and the Joint Capabilities Board decided that the Urgent Operational Requirement should be departmentally funded. In April 2008 the JULIUS project was formally initiated and a sole-source procurement strategy for eight aircraft was endorsed with Boeing as prime contractor using Thales cockpit displays. In December 2008 the Main Gate Business Case to modify eight aircraft to the JULIUS standard was approved. The Initial Operating Capability was defined as two aircraft available for deployment at the required capability with all Defence Lines of Development in place including simulator, out of four aircraft delivered, by September 2011 (50%
confidence level).

Project New Buy:
A full firm price Demonstration and Manufacture contract was signed with Boeing on the 29th July 2011. In September 2011 the Platform Critical Design Review was successfully passed. Completing the Review was a major milestone towards achieving an agreed design baseline and providing assurance that the project was on-track. In March 2012 the cabin and aft structures for the first aircraft (tail number ZK550) were built and the aircraft moved to final assembly. A senior Boeing/MoD independent programme review took place in March 2012 and concluded that there were additional risks surrounding the integration of the Digital Auto Flight Control System and that the flight test schedule, whilst adequate in flying hours, provides limited scope in programme timescale to address any issues identified during flight test. As a consequence, we have now declared a delay in Entry into Service of six months to November 2014 to accommodate these additional risks. Project JULIUS:
A Demonstration and Manufacture contract was placed on 29th January 2009 with Boeing as the Prime Contractor, and based on the Thales ‘Top Deck’ glass cockpit solution. The Through-Life Customer Support partnering contract with Boeing was used as the tasking arrangement. In July 2009 the Main Gate Business Case to modify the rest of the Chinook fleet (remaining 40 aircraft at the time) was approved. In August 2009 two Chinook aircraft were destroyed on operations in Afghanistan. Rather than reduce the JULIUS approval by two aircraft sets, the subsequent New Buy approval was abated by the same amount. In June 2011, during Test and Evaluation, issues with software, firmware and Electromagnetic Compatibility surfaced that necessitated a forecast delay of three months to Initial Operating Capability. The 50% confidence date was now reported as December 2011. In August the JULIUS 8 and 40 projects were merged, and going forward project performance will be

<sup>Enter Text Here</sup>reported against Julius as a whole.

In October 2011 a reappraisal of technical risks and delivery timescales concluded that a further design iteration was required. Consequently, an intense period of rig and flight testing began to resolve the following primary issues: Vertical Speed Indicators (VSI) Analogue to Digital Conversion;
Electromagnetic Compatibility of the Multi Function Displays; and Mission Management System functionality. The Initial Operating Capability was forecast to be delayed to May 2012. In March 2012 an issue with how the aircraft’s height relative to the surrounding terrain is displayed in the cockpit emerged during Release to Service activity. Consequently, the forecast for Initial Operating Capability was delayed by a further 11 months, to April 2013.

# A.4 In-year Progress

Project New Buy:

Key scheduled activities have been completed, including: delivery of software releases from Thales; Government Furnished Assets Working Group held; Test and Evaluation Working Groups held in preparation for the Test Readiness Review. Aircraft continue to be built on the production line. As of the end of May 2012, Aircraft 4 was at the Cabin Cockpit Splice stage and Aircraft 3 Cabin had been painted.

Project JULIUS:

The Mk 4 Release to Service was signed by Assistant Chief of the Air Staff on the 11th May 2012, enabling aircrew to begin training on the aircraft. Aircrew training is underway to support operations and Initial Operating Capability was achieved on June 15th 2012, against the initial approval of September 2011. As of the end of May 2012, MOD had accepted 5 aircraft in total. The overarching project remains on schedule to meet its Full Operating Capability in October 2015.

# A.5 Capability Risks

Project New Buy:

There is an urgent need to replace those aircraft recently lost on operations and to build MOD's CH-47 capability in theatre to allow for the withdrawal of Sea King Mk4. Further investment will be required to address obsolescence and sustain the Chinook fleet to the planned Out of Service Date of 2040.

Project JULIUS:

The requirement stemmed from the need to operate in Low Ambient Light Conditions in Afghanistan and addressing the safety and airworthiness concerns of the current Night Enhancement Package.

Since May 2006, the in-service Chinook fleet has been successfully supported through a spares-inclusive availability based contract with Boeing, known as Through-Life Customer Support. The second five-year pricing period of Through-Life Customer Support commenced in 2011. An amendment has been made to this contract to incrementally include the new standard of aircraft (Mk4) as the fleet changes configuration. An amendment will also be made to this contract to incrementally include the new aircraft (Mk6) as they enter the fleet. Through-Life Customer Support is the most cost-effective way of delivering support to Chinook and has consistently demonstrated Value for Money in line with increased operational output.

The Assessment phase cost reported is lower than that reported in Major Projects Report 2011. This is because when the Demonstration and Manufacture phase was approved, the approval included some money that was originally approved as part of the Assessment phase approval. These costs are now included at B.2 and B.3.
