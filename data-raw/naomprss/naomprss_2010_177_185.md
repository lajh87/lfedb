Number of Projects / Increments

Tornado Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot) Provides a Single Integrated Demonstration,

Manufacturing and in-Service Phase for Three Capabilities that will be Delivered in Two Work Packages.

Secure Communications on Tornado and Integration of Precision Guided Bomb will be Delivered as Capability A. Tactical Information Exchange Capability will be Delivered as Capability B.

Current Status of Projects / Increments

• Post Main Investment Decision - Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot) – Capability a and B

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Tornado Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot) Addresses Growing Shortfalls in the RAF’s Ability to Operate in the Network Enabled Environment and Achieve Interoperability with Coalition Partners While Delivering Precision Effect.

The Requirement is in Three Parts.

Secure Communications on Tornado Aims to Provide a Jam Resistant Secure Line of Sight Communications Capability that is Interoperable with NATO Partners.

Integration of Precision Guided Bomb Fulfils the Requirement for an all-Weather Precision Attack Capability that Was Identified Following Operations in Kosovo and Iraq.

Tactical Information Exchange Capability will Provide a Digital Messaging Facility in Addition to the Current Voice Only Capability to Increase Overall Mission Effectiveness.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

In May 2006, Initial Gate Business Case Approval Was Given to Proceed with an Assessment Phase Designed to Establish and Develop an Alternative Procurement Option for Delivering the Tornado GR4/4a Requirements for the Aircraft Integration of Tactical Information Exchange Capability,

Precision Guided Bomb and Secure Communications on Tornado (Previously Called Secure Communications for Aircraft as a Core Programme). the Approval Authorised a £1m MOD Commitment.

Subsequently, in August 2007, a Review Note Approved an Extended Assessment Phase as a Result of Delays to the Main Gate Business Case and Increased the Approved Funding to £12m. the Main Gate Business Case Was Submitted in December 2007. an Independent Investment Appraisal Indicated Savings of £56m by Combining Individual Capability Projects under a Common Project.

## A.3. Progress

Following Main Gate Approval in December 2007 the Contract Was Placed with BAE Systems. a Number of Milestones Have Been Reached Within the Project, the Most Pertinent Being as Follows:

Capability a Has Passed both the Preliminary and Customer Design Reviews and the First Trial Installation Aircraft Was Completed in February 2010. the Second Trial Installation Aircraft is Due to Complete in May 2010 with the First Two Aircraft to Have Capability a Embodied Being Accepted into the Combined Maintenance Unit at Marham in October 2010.

Capability B Has Passed the Preliminary Design Review and is Due Customer Design Review in August 2010. the First Trial Installation Aircraft is Due to Complete in November 2011.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Tornado Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot) will Address Growing Shortfalls in Tornado Mission Effectiveness Through Secure, Network Enabled Information Exchange; Smart Weapon Integration and Provide a Sustainable Solution for Current Operations.
