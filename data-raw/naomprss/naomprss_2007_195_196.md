# SECTION 1: ABOUT the REQUIREMENT

Search and Rescue - Helicopter (SAR-H) is a Joint Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Maritime and Coastguard Agency ((MCA) - An Agency of the Department for Transport (DfT)) Programme. It Seeks to Replace the Current Search and Rescue Capability, Provided Around the UK (and Potentially the Falkland Islands) by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy, using Sea King Helicopters, and Through the MCA Service Contract.

It is Planned to Introduce the New Service Progressively in the Next Decade, when the MCA Contract Expires and the Sea Kings Come to the End of their Planned Lives. Following MoD and DfT Ministerial Approvals to Enter Assessment Phase 2, a Competition under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), Was Launched in May 2006 Following European Union Procurement Regulations.

# SECTION 2: THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

Note: Actual in Service Dates and Costs are not Set until Projects Reach the Point in Time when the Main Investment Decision is Made I.e Main Gate Approval. Until this Point all Costs and Dates are Outline Assumptions Solely for Internal Planning Purposes.

## 2a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The SAR-H Assessment Phase Was Approved in 2 Phases – AP1 and AP2. AP1 Considered the Range

Of Procurement Options as Outlined in the SAR-H Initial Gate Approval, Resulting in a Recommendation for a Joint MoD/MCA Competitive PFI Procurement Strategy.

MoD Ministerial Approval for AP2 to Implement the Joint MoD/MCA Competitive PFI Procurement Strategy Was Gained via the Future Rotorcraft Capability Initial Gate Business Case and Followed by DfT Minister Approval of a Parallel Business Case.
