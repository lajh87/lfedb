# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Requirement Changes

Following a \\\ in the Prototype Core at the Naval Reactor Test Establishment (NRTE), the Secretary of

State (SofS) of Defence Announced on 6th March 2014 (Hansard Ref 1077-1088) the Intent to Refuel HMS Vanguard and to Maintain Options to Refuel HMS Victorious. the Decision Has Significantly Impacted Upon CPC along with 8 Other Projects. as a Result of the SofS’ Announcement the
‘new Requirement’ for CPC is to Manufacture One Additional Core H and Maintain the Option Open to Enable Refuel of HMS Victorious Should the Decision be Made to Do So. This Has Consequently Increased the Approved Scope at Main Gate in 2012. the Impact on Cost and Time Was Included in the Core H Refuel and Resilience (CHRAR) Review Note, which Was Approved by the MoD Investment Appraisal Committee (IAC) in March 2015. the New Approval, Including the Increase in Requirements Has Been Reflected in this PSS.

Background

To Maintain a Naval Reactor Core Production Capability (CPC) to Support the UK’s Nuclear Submarine Flotilla. All Royal Navy Submarine Propulsion Nuclear Reactor Cores Have Been Manufactured at the RollsRoyce (RR) Raynesway Site Since the 1960s. RR are the Only Company with the Capability to Design and Manufacture Nuclear Fuel for this Specialist Application.

To Conduct Nuclear Operations on the Raynesway Site, Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations Limited is ‘licensed’ Formally by the Office for Nuclear Regulation as Required by the Nuclear Installations Act. as the Nuclear Site Licensee, Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations Limited Has a Legal Requirement to Undertake a Periodic Review of Safety Every 10 Years, with the Last Review Completing in 2012. the Periodic Review of Safety Requires the Licensee to Review the Activities Conducted on the Site and the Hazards Arising from Them and Compare with Relevant Good Practice. the 2002 Periodic Review of Safety Identified that the Current Facilities, Constructed in the Late 1950s Have a Number of Shortcomings Against Relevant Good Nuclear and Environmental Standards. the Continuation of Nuclear Operations to Support the Submarine Programme Post 2012 Requires Capital Investment to Meet the Latest Standards.

The Technological and Manufacturing Capability to Produce Submarine Reactor Cores Has Traditionally Been Sustained Through Successive Contracts for their Production. with the Introduction of Long Life Cores and the Reduction in the Submarine Flotilla Size the Numerical Requirement for Cores Has Reduced.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) White Paper Deferred the in-Service Date (ISD) for the Successor SSBN to 2028 with a 36 Month Drumbeat.

Delivery

Pre 6th March 2014

-   Delivery Confidence: Green

-   Broadly on Track to Deliver to Time and Cost, Following Initial Delay to the Start of Construction, Following Extended Contract Negotiations (Contract Placement in 2012).

-   Graham Construction Makes Positive Progress to the Start of Phase 1 Construction (New Clean Shop, Reception Centre & Energy Centre).

-   CH2MHILL (Regeneration Project Management) Provide Valuable Experience to Deliver Regeneration to Time and Cost.

-   Gained 1 Month Back Against MPR 2014.

-   ‘gain and Maintain Control’ Workstream Highlighting Quality Issues but Plans are in Place and on Track to Deliver Core Requirements to Meet both the Submarine Programme and CPC (Main Gate Scope) Programme.

Post 6th March 2014

-   Delivery Confidence: Amber – to Reflect the Additional Challenges the Project Faces Following the Increased Scope of the Project.

-   5 Year Deferment to the Demolition of the Current (Old) Clean Shop and Subsequent Start of Phase 2 of Regeneration in Order to Provide the Increased Capacity to Manufacture the Additional Core and to Maintain the Option Open to Refuel HMS Victorious, without Impact on the Production of Core J for Successor • Cost Impact of
£196m (CDEL & RDEL, Inc Risk, Profit & VAT) to Cover Parallel Running of Two Clean Shops (Inc Running Costs), Additional Inspection Capacity, Resources and Core Materials, Revised Nuclear Site Safety Case to ONR.

-   MoD Working with R-R and CH2MHILL to Reduce Impact and Realise Opportunities on the Regeneration Acivities.

-   Current Planning Assumption is that There is No Impact to Astute or Successor Programmes in Terms of Reactor Core Delivery.

The Forecast for the Completion of all the New Facilities is Now June 2026, Due to the Deferment of the Second Phase of Construction by Five Years in Order to Manufacture the Additional H Cores. This Date is Five Years Later than the Date of May 2021 Approved at Main Gate.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

In September 2007, the Investment Appraisals Board Approved the CPC Initial Gate Business Case, to Down Select to the Phased Regeneration of the Rolls-Royce Raynesway Site, as the Most Cost Effective Way of Delivering the Capability.

Prior to Main Gate Contract Being Awarded, Two Review Notes Were Approved to Continue the Assessment Phase and Enable the Department to Explore Other more Advantageous Commercial Arrangements.

In 2010 it Became Apparent that Several Stakeholders, Including HM Treasury, Required a more Detailed Review of the Options to Refurbish the Current Facilities to Establish Whether it Offered Improved Value for Money. This Led to Director Submarines Directing a Study into the Viability of Refurbishing the Current Facilities to Meet the CPC Requirements and Formally Presenting this as an Option for Main Gate.

The Assessment Phase Contract Was Let on 13th February 2008. This Contract Covered Assessment Phase Work Up to February 2010.

The Interim Contract Was Placed on 4th February 2010 to Cover the Work Required to Complete Assessment Phase Activities Up to Placement of the Main Phase Contract on 23rd April 2012.

In January 2012 the IAC Approved the Review Note Requesting Release of Funding Against the Main Gate Business Case. the Advanced Funding Was Required to Maintain Capability and Continuation of the Programme i.e. Sustainment.

During the Assessment Phase of the CPC Project, Rolls-Royce Power Engineering Have Continued to Produce Nuclear Cores for the Astute Class Ship Submersible Nuclear (SSN).

## A.3. Project History

April 2012: HMT Approved the CPC Main Gate Business Case.

April 2012: Placement of the Main Phase CPC Contract. the Scope Includes the Full Regeneration of CPC and Sustainment of Capability to March 2023 and Production and Delivery of 2 Cores.

May 2012: IAC Approval of Main Gate Business Case.

The CPC Contract Includes the Delivery of 2 Cores (H12 \[astute Boat 7\]
And J1 \[successor Boat 1\]). Approval for J1 is Included Within the CPC Main Gate Business Case and H12 is Included Within the Astute Submarine Programme Approval of Aug 2011.

\\\

May 2012 to January 2013: Construction Contract Tender Evaluation.

November 2012: Following the Licensed Site Periodic Safety Review (PSR), the Health and Safety Executive’s Office for Nuclear Regulation Concluded that Normal Operation of the Licensed Site can Continue Whilst a Programme of Work to Implement a Number of Improvements is Progressed.

December 2012: Rolls-Royce Place Contract with Sub-Contractor CH2MHILL to Provide the Project Support.

January 2013: Rolls-Royce Place Contract for Construction with Graham Construction. Work Commenced on Site. the Demolition of Nuclear Manufacturing Services Was Completed in January 2013 in Preparation for the Start of Phase 1.

March 2013: Demolition of the Operations Management Centre Was Completed.

March 2013: Contract Amendment to Bring H11 under CPC from the Core Batch Buy Contract.

May 2013: Manufacturing Facility 1st Build Piling Commenced.

Cores Have Been Delivered in-Year to Support the Submarine Programme.

May 2013: Reactor Core \\\ Development for Successor (SSBN) Explicitly Included in CPC J Core Development.

July 2013: Piling of the Energy Centre and Reception Centre Was Completed.

August 2013: Piling of Manufacturing Facility 1st Build Was Completed.

October 2013: Steel Frame Erected for the Energy Centre.

November 2013: As a Result of a Requirement for the Improved Inspection of J Core, Arising from Naval Reactor Test Establishment Investigations, a Baseline Change Request Was Approved for Rolls-Royce to Investigate the Impact of Improved Techniques. the Impact of this Decision is not Reflected in MPR14.

December 2013: Steel Frame Erected for the Reception Centre.

March 2014: Steel Frame Work Erected for Manufacturing Facility 1st Build.

6^th^ March 2014: The Secretary of State for Defence Made a Statement to Parliament Announcing His Decision to Refuel HMS Vanguard in 2015, Following the Detection of Low Level Radiation in the Cooling Water of the Prototype Core at the Naval Reactor Test Establishment. as a Result, CPC Plans to Present a Review Note to the IAB in November 2014. the Impact of this Decision is not Reflected in MPR14, but will Lead to Additional H Cores and Associated Costs.

## A.4. in-Year Progress

April 2014: Decision to Enhance the Core Production Inspection Regime for Core J Following Manufacturing Review in Light of the \\\ on H Core.

September 2014: Commenced Manufacturing Facility 1st Build Building Services Fit Out.

October 2014: Completion of Reception Centre Building Structure and Exterior Walls.

November 2014: Revised Core H Production Rates Established to Deliver a Reduced 12 Month Float on Delivery for H10, H11 and H12 and 9 Months Float on H13 (Replacement Core for Astute Boat 7 – See Below) and H14 (if Required for HMS Victorious).

December 2014: Completion of Manufacturing Facility 1st Build Structural Frame.

January 2015: Core H Refuel and Resilience (CHRAR) Review Note Submitted to the MoD Investment Appraisal Committee (IAC).

January 2015: Inspection Capacity Increased to De-Risk Product Quality Issues in the Light of the \\\.

March 2015: On the 9^th^, the IAC Approved the Core H Refuel and Resilience Review Note. the Review Note Included Annexes from all Nine Projects Impacted by the Secretary of State for Defence’s Announcement to Parliament on 6^th^ March 2014. the CPC Annex Sought Approval of a Deferred Full Operating Capability Date (5 Years) and £196m to Meet the Requirement to Manufacture at Least One Core and Make Provision for a Second.

March 2015: Core H9 Containerised Ready for Delivery to Barrow-in-Furness in \\\ to Meet the Core Load Programme in \\\

April 2015: Core H Production Rates Established and Maintaining the 12 Months Float for H11 and H12 and 9 Months for H13 and H14.

As a Result of the Diversion of Core H10 from the Astute Programme to Refuel HMS Vanguard, and the Consequential Extension of H Core Production, to Include an Additional H Core, There is Increased Pressure on the Manufacturing Programme, Resulting in Reduced CPC Programme Float of 12 Months for H11 and H12 and 9 Months for H13 and H14.

The Development and Production of Core J1 for Successor Boat 1 Remains on Track to Meet the Required Delivery Date to Barrow-in-Furness to Support the Requried in Service Date of 2028.

## A.5. Capability Risks

Delivery of the CPC Project is Essential in Order to Maintain the Capability to Manufacture Nuclear Reactor Cores for the Submarine Programme and Support Development Work on the Successor Core Design and Manufacturing Processes.

The CPC Project will Maintain the Nuclear Site Licence and Essential Manufacturing and Engineering Skills; These Would Require Significant Time and Cost to Recover and Therefore Represent an Intolerable Risk to the Successor Deterrent Core Production Schedule and Subsequent in-Service Date.

The \\\ at the Naval Reactor Test Establishment Has Led to a Substantial Increase in the Level of Inspection Required for Current Manufacturing in Order to be Confident that Potential \\\, Associated with Core Manufacturing, are not Present in Future Cores. This Increased Capacity Has Been Delivered and is in Operation.
