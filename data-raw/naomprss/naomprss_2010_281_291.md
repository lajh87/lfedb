3707 Vehicles are in-Service (End of March 10), a Number of which Have Been Delivered to Theatre to Support Current Operations. Under the Urgent Operational Requirements Process £25.4m Has Been Used to Produce an Enhanced Palletised Load System (a Modified Variant of the 15t SV) to Provide a Protected Vehicle with a Palletised Load and Container Handling Facility to Meet a Capability Gap. a Further £16.7m Has Been Used to Up-Rate the Protection Systems Employed by the Vehicles to Counter the Escalating Threat Levels.

Further Support to Operations via the Urgent Operational Requirements Process Has Resulted in £57.2 Being Approved to Procure Additional Enhanced Palletised Load System Vehicles and Increase the Support Vehicle Theatre Entry Standard Fleet to Meet Operational Demand and Raise the Protection Levels Afforded by the Original Support Vehicle and Enhanced Palletised Load System Theatre Entry Standard Fleets Procured Previously.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Support Vehicle Programme is Procuring the Tri-Service Cargo, Unit Support Tanker and Recovery Vehicles to Improve Military Lift/Distribution and Recovery Capability. It will Replace the Inservice 4, 8 and 14 Tonne Cargo Vehicles, the Cargo Trailer Fleet and the in-Service Recovery Vehicles. for Cost Reasons the Quantity of Vehicles Finally Purchased will not be Capable of Fully Supporting Defence Strategic Guidance 2008 Medium Scale Enduring, Medium Scale Non-Enduring and Small Scale Non-Enduring Concurrent Commitments - this Risk Has Been Accepted by the MOD.

The Risks of not Procuring the Support Vehicle Capability Are:

1.  the Increased Costs of Running on the Obsolescent in-Service Fleet.

2.  the Obsolescent in-Service Fleet Does not Have the Capability to Provide the Required Levels of Protection to Troops in Theatre.

Current Status of Projects

• Support: Trojan and Titan

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Project Delivered New Vehicles to Provide an Armoured Engineer Capability to Meet the Army’s Requirements, Namely: Titan which is an Armoured Bridge-Layer, and Trojan which is an Armoured Obstacle Breaching Vehicle. They Have Replaced the Chieftain Vehicles which Were over 30 Years Old, and are the First Purpose-Built Engineer Vehicles to be Procured Since the Second World War. They are Based on the Challenger 2 Hull and are as Well Protected, Mobile and Reliable. They Have a Variety of Specialist Equipments to Provide Effective Engineer Support for Armoured and Armouredinfantry Units.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

The Trojan & Titan Project Was Endorsed, Pre-Smart Procurement, by Staff Targets (Land) 4093 and

4094 in May 1996. the Approval Noted the Intention to Move Directly into Demonstration and

Manufacture Following the Feasibility Study. This Was Delayed Due to the 1998 Strategic Defence Review but it Was Completed in February 2000 with Vickers Defence Systems Being Selected, Through Competitive Tender as the Preferred Bidder for the Demonstration & Manufacture Phase. the Feasibility Study Options Were Considered for Technical Risk and Requirement Compliance and the Vickers Defence Systems Challenger 2 Option Was Deemed the Lowest Risk.

## A.3. Progress

The Demonstration & Manufacture Contract Was Let in March 2001 with the First Production Vehicle (of 66) Delivered in October 2005. in Service Date Was Achieved on Batch 1 Vehicles in October 2006. Alvis Acquired Vickers Defence Systems in 2002 and BAE Systems Took over the Procurement Contract from Alvis-Vickers in 2004. the Original Procurement Strategy and Main Gate Business Case Did not Include an Initial Operating Capability. However, as the in Service Date Did not Provide a Deployable Military Capability it Was Proposed by Director Capability Integration (Army), in December 2006, to Introduce an Initial Operating Capability. the Definition of Initial Operating Capability Was Promulgated in January 2007.

Acceptance of Batches 2-4, via Reliability Trials, Has Been Achieved and the Batch Test 5 Trials are Ongoing (Due to Complete in June 2010). Initial Operating Capability for Trojan Was Declared in August 2007, but Initial Operating Capability for Titan Has Been Delayed Due to Technical Problems with the Bridge Launching Mechanism and the Nuclear Biological and Chemical/Environmental Control System. This is Now Scheduled for June 2010.

Post-in Service Date, BAE Systems Has Had to Do Significant Technical Re-Development Work which Has Led to Delays to the Project. However, as this is a Fixed Price Contract There Have Been Minimal Increased Costs to MOD Whilst BAE Systems Has Incurred Substantial Additional Costs. BAE Systems is to be Commended for Its Willingness to Complete this Work, without Re-Course to the Contract, Despite the Losses it Has Incurred.

On Successful Conclusion of Batch Test 5 the Final Acceptance Build Standard will be Agreed with

BAE Systems, and all 66 Platforms will then be Upgraded to Final Acceptance Build Standard by BAE
