# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The MoD requires a sustainable military Terminal Air Traffic Management (ATM) capability that will enable air vehicles to operate safely and effectively with tactical freedom, in all weather conditions and in any environment, within UK Areas of Responsibility, including permanent overseas airfields, and in support of UK and coalition forces worldwide. The Marshall project provides this capability via a contract of 22 years duration (with appropriate contractual break points) with Aquila ATMS Ltd for the design, acquisition, installation, sustained delivery and assurance of a military Terminal ATM Service. The capability is operated by military personnel (except in those locations that have previously civilianised ATM operations).

The authority to operate and regulate UK military aircraft is vested in the Secretary of State for Defence who has directed that the MOD maintains equivalence with civil Air Traffic Management (ATM) legislation in so far as is reasonably practicable, whilst ensuring national security and continued operational capability. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review confirmed the requirement for the provision of ATM services within Future Force 2020.

The equipment that currently supports Terminal ATM is becoming increasingly obsolete with key elements becoming unsustainable beyond 2015. Furthermore, new capabilities are required to maintain civil interoperability: the mandated implementation of Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) Mode S and the adoption of 8.33KHz channel spacing on VHF communications; Marshall is addressing these issues while delivering significant financial benefits compared to the cost of the current capability.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The assessment phase of the Marshall project was conducted in two parts. The first part (Assessment Phase 1) was approved on the 17th January 2008. The purpose was to both express the military air traffic services in output terms through the development of an output based specification and to determine the most appropriate and cost effective delivery solution for this service. In addition, the project has captured data on the condition of the existing air traffic control infrastructure (control towers, radar towers, radio masts etc.) as well as the number of people employed in supporting the service. Part 1 of the Assessment Phase completed in October 2009 with the submission of a Review Note seeking approval for Part 2. In December 2010 Joint Military Air Traffic Services changed its name to Project Marshall.

Part 2 of the Assessment Phase enabled formal industry engagement. The project followed the

Competitive Dialogue procedure to determine the most economically advantageous solution for the MARSHALL requirement. A notification in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) initiating the formal procurement process was issued in March 2011. Three consortia, Aquila (Thales and National Air Traffic Services), BAE Systems, and Fusion (Lockheed Martin, Selex and Cobham) were selected to participate in Competitive Dialogue. In January 2012 a dedicated Team Leader for the Marshall project was appointed in accordance with the recommendations of an Office of Government Commerce Gateway 0 review.

## A.3 Project History

The three competing consortia submitted their outline solution proposals in January 2013. Following evaluation of the proposals, an initial round of competitive dialogue was conducted with each bidder. BAE Systems took the strategic decision to withdraw from the competition in September 2013. The remaining two bidders, Aquila and Fusion submitted detailed solution proposals in January 2014; these proposals were evaluated, and a second round of competitive dialogue commenced.

## A.4 In-Year Progress

Following review by the Chief of Defence Material on 31 March 2014, timescales for contract award were accelerated to de-conflict with purdah ahead of the General Election. The Main Gate Business Case was signed on 11 August 2014, Evaluation of final tender bids commenced on 28 August 2014 and concluded on 28 September 2014. The contract was signed between MOD and Aquila Air Traffic Management Services on 28 October 2014. Contract signature was followed by a 6 month mobilization phase in preparation for Aquila taking on responsibility for the availability of in-scope legacy equipment on 01 April 2015. The mobilisation phase included the preparation for Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment (TUPE) Transfer of MOD and contractor staff;
development of working practices for operation and maintenance personnel; development of governance structures and procedures for equipment installation to enable Aquila to take on service delivery responsibility from 1^st^ April 2015.

## A.5 Capability Risks

Much of the equipment that currently provides air traffic services to MOD airfields and ranges is in excess of 20 years old and is increasingly suffering from obsolescence. Furthermore increasing regulation of United Kingdom airspace requires the implementation of new radar surveillance capability. Failure to invest in this capability will ultimately reduce the level of air traffic service provision to MOD operated airfields and associated sites in the UK and overseas. This will reduce the ability of the Front Line Command’s (FLC’s) to train and fly and hence the ability to project air power wherever and whenever it is required.

The successful roll-out of new equipment under Marshall will offset the equipment obsolescence risk. The previous piece-meal arrangements for provision of ATM equipment and support meant that MOD held the risk of equipment un-availability; this risk is now transferred to Aquila. However, the previous arrangements did provide MOD with the ability to change equipment laydown, for example increasing equipment numbers or moving equipment between sites – under Marshall, changes to requirement are implemented via contract amendment in order to adjust the services and availability provided to specific sites. This is a consequence of contracting for assured levels of availability rather than piece-meal equipment arrangements, but may be perceived by Users and their chains of command as a lack of agility. The Senior Responsible owner (SRO) is managing the cultural change required in the ATM operational community.
