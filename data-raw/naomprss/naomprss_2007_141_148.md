# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Terrier is Designed to be a Highly Mobile, Robust and Reliable Armoured Earthmoving Vehicle, which will Support Mobility, Counter Mobility and Survivability Throughout the Spectrum of Conflict. It will be Optimised for Battlefield Preparation and Used by Close Support (CS) Engineer Units. Terrier is Being Procured to Replace the Capability Provided by the Combat Engineer Tractors (CET). the Programme Was Let under Competitive Tender and is Now over Midway Through Its Demonstration Phase which is Due to Complete in January 2009. Throughout the Year the Prototype Vehicle Has Been Used to Prove the Technical Capability of Terrier and to Start the Reliability Improvement Programme. the Programme Has Been Adversely Affected by a Change in the Customer’s Requirement for Bowman Communications System;
this Has Required the Instigation of a New Project to Develop and Demonstrate a Revised Fit for Terrier. the Consequence of this Change is Reflected in this Report. There Has Been Progress with the

A400M Aircraft in so Much as it Has Been Shown Technically Feasible to Reinforce the Cargo Floor. the

A400M Integrated Project Team (IPT) Has an Action in Hand for this Modification. the Four Demonstrator Vehicles are in the Course of Construction and will be Available for the Next Phase of Testing over the Next Six Months. Release for Production (Milestone 12) is the Next Key Event and is Planned for Late 2007.

## 3e. Operational Impact of ISD Variation

The Requirements Change for the Bowman Communications System Was Driven by the End User Organisations as a Result of Tests Carried Out on the Installation in Combat Engineer Tractor (CET). the Choice Lay Between Accepting Terrier into Service with a Bowman Installation which Could not Support the Operational Communications Required for Safe Operation or Accepting a Delay to the ISD. Balancing the Operational Risk of Having a Severely Limited Terrier Capability Due to the Safety Concerns, or Having a Fully Capable One Late, the Customer Chose the Latter. the Current Situation with CET is that in View of the Safety Concerns, it can Only be Used on Operations under a Waiver Signed at 2 Star or in a Highly Controlled Training Environment where Communication Off Platform is not Required. Those CET that Have Been Converted to a Bowman Communications Fit are Being Held in a Controlled Humidity Environment at the Ashchurch Storage Facility so that Should an Operational Waiver be Signed They can be Delivered to the Operation.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

A Funded Feasibility Study for Terrier Concluded that the Most Cost-Effective Way of Meeting the Requirement Was to Develop a New Vehicle, where Possible Integrating in-Service Sub-Systems and Commercial Off-the-Shelf Equipment. Approval Was Given for a Competitive Project Definition Phase in August 1998 and Firm Price Contracts Were Placed in August 1999 with BAE Systems (with the Work Undertaken by Its Subsidiary Royal Ordnance Plc) and Vickers Defence Systems. Both Contractors Developed Detailed Designs Making Extensive Use of Computer Aided Design Tools, Virtual Reality Modelling, Rigs and Trials. the Capabilities Required and Constraints Imposed by Physical Limitations, Such as Rail and Air Transportability, Resulted in Very Similar Technical Solutions. Both Contractors Offered Tracked Vehicles Close in Size Weight and Mobility to the Warrior Tracked Infantry Fighting Vehicle, Having a Crew of Two and Providing Protection Against Small Arms, High Explosive Fragments and Mines. an Invitation to Tender (ITT) Was Issued in February 2001 to both Companies which Sought Detailed Proposals and Prices for all Later Phases. the ITT also Adopted Smart Acquisition Initiatives Such as Progressive Acceptance and Innovative Contractor Logistic Support Proposals. the Main Gate Business Case Was Approved on 17 July 2002. the Contract for Demonstration,

Manufacture and Phase 1 Contractor Logistic Support Was Placed with Royal Ordnance Plc on 19 July 2002.
