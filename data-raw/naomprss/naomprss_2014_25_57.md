# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Military Requirement is for Up to 8 Astute Class Nuclear Powered Attack Submarines to Replace the Existing Trafalgar Class.

Astute Class Submarines are Required to Perform a Range of Military Tasks; These Unique Requirements are Combined Within the Astute Design to Provide Global Reach, Endurance, Covertness, Sustained High Speed and the Ability to Conduct Unsupported Operations in Hostile Environments.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

In June 1991 (Equivalent of Initial Gate) Approval Was Given to Proceed with a Programme of Studies at an Estimated Cost of £6 Million (1991/1992 Prices) to Define the Batch 2 Trafalgar Class Submarine (Now Known as the Astute Class). This Programme of Studies Led to the Issue of an Invitation to Tender for the Design and Build of an Initial Batch of Three Astute Class Submersible Ship Nuclear (SSN) and a Further Approval of £2 Million (1992/1993 Prices) for Contractor and Defence Research Agency Support to MOD During the Tendering Exercise in 1994.

In July 1994, as a Result of Concerns over the Overall Affordability of the Programme, Minister (Defence Procurement) and the Treasury Approved a Further £24 Million (at 1993/1994 Prices) for Risk Reduction Studies to be Undertaken in Parallel with the Formal Bid Phase of the Project. to Maintain an Effective Competition, Contracts for Risk Reduction Were Awarded to both Bidders, GEC Marconi (Now BAE Systems Maritime-Submarines) and Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd.

GEC-Marconi Was Identified as MOD’s Preferred Bidder in December 1995. Using the Policy of No Acceptable Price No Contract, a Prime Contract Was Placed in March 1997 for the Design, Build and Initial in Service Support of the First Three of the Class.

## A.3. Project History

Please Refer to Previous MPRs for Historical Data on the Astute Class Programme.

Approvals

On 20 July 2011 Her Majesty’s Treasury Approved Revised Time and Costs for Boats 1 to 4 and Approved

Main Build for Boat 5, Initial Build for Boat 6 and Long Lead Items for Boat 7. at this Time the Investment

Approvals Committee also Approved in-Service Dates for Boats 5, 6 and 7. on 8 June 2012 Her Majesty’s Treasury Approved the Whole Astute Programme (Boats 1 – 7) and Corresponding Astute Support Solution.

Boat 1 HMS ASTUTE

In June 2011 HMS ASTUTE Successfully Completed the UK Phase of Contractor Sea Trials. While on a Comprehensive Sea Trials Programme in US Waters the Submarine Successfully Completed the First of Class

British Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles Firing Trials, Final Spearfish Deep Discharge Trials and Underwater

Magnetic Silencing; Returning to Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde in March 2012 to Commence Base

Maintenance Period Number 6. as a Further Element of the First of Class Sea Trials Programme HMS ASTUTE Has Been Fitted with a Payload Bay which Has Now Been Proven and Demonstrated Its Additional Capability.

<th>boat 2 AMBUSH Boat 2 AMBUSH Was Launched and Lowered in to the Basin Outside of the Devonshire Dock Hall on 6 January 2011. the Submarine Successfully Completed Her First Test Dive in the Shipyard’s Basin in Early October 2011. Boat 2 HMS AMBUSH Exited the Shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness on 15 September 2012 and Undertook the Initial Platform Proving Phase of Contractors Sea Trials Through to December 2012. Following a Maintenance Period at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde, the Submarine Completed the Second, Capability Proving Sea Trial Phase at the End of July 2013. HMS AMBUSH Reached Contract Acceptance Stage 1 Platform Demonstration, on 14 December 2012 from which Point it Has Been Managed as an in-Service Submarine under MOD Rather than Contractor Direction. HMS Ambush Was Formally Commissioned into the Royal Navy at HMNB Clyde on 1 March 2013. Boat 3 ARTFUL Continues Construction in the Devonshire Dock Hall at Barrow and is Making Good Progress with Diesel Generator Trials Successfully Completed in August 2011. It is Anticipated that ARTFUL will Leave the Devonshire Dock Hall in 2013 and Exit Barrow Approximately 12 Months Later to Commence Sea Trials. a Delay in Supply of Key Nuclear Steam Raising Plant Components and a Shortfall in Volume of Construction and Outfit Work Against the Plan Has Prevented Scheduled Core Load from Being Achieved. a Number of Performance Improvement Activities Have Been Put in Place by the Contractor to Ensure that the Programme Remains on Track to Achieve Operational Handover in 2015. Boat 4 AUDACIOUS; all Hull and Casing Units Have Been Moved to the Devonshire Dock Hall and a Number of the Internal Equipment Modules Have also Been Shipped Inside the Respective Units. First Phase of Reactor Loop Build Was Successfully Completed and Main Propulsion Machinery Package Shore Trials Have Begun (Pre-Shipping). Two Key Pressure Hull Unit-to-Unit Welds Have Commenced. the Whole Boat Contract, which Introduced Revised Management Arrangements and more Robust Terms Aimed at Driving Delivery, Was Signed 1 November 2012. the Command Deck Module Was Integrated into Sub Unit 6/7 in December 2012. Boat 5 ANSON Had Her ‘keel Laid’ on 13 October 2011, at a Traditional Keel Laying Ceremony where the Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth Unveiled a Section of Her Hull. the Submarine Has Continued the Open Outfit Stage in the Devonshire Dock Hall with some Fabrication Continuing in the New Assembly Shop. Boats 6 and 7 Further Tranches of Material Have Been Procured for Boat 6 and Procurement of Long Lead Items for Boat 7 Have Commenced. Following Receipt of Whole Programme Approval in June 2012 the Programme Has Pursued a Number of Opportunities to Batch Buy Materials for Boats 5-7, Delivering Cost Savings to the Programme and Protecting the Later Boats from the Potential Impact of Material Shortfalls. ASTUTE CLASS TRAINING SERVICE the Astute Class Training Service (ACTS) Has Provided Training for the Ships Companies of both HMS ASTUTE and AMBUSH and Commenced Training for the Crew of ARTFUL. on 15 February 2012 the Investment Approvals Committee Approved the Astute Class Training Service Boat 4 Information Note which Articulated a Revised Funding Approach for the ACTS Boat 4 Change Delivering a Saving Against the 2007 Astute Class Training Service Boat 4 Approval. the Training Service Provider, FAST, Have Submitted their Bid for the Addition of Training for Boat 4 Crews from May 2015. SUPPORT SMP’s Revised Approval Sought to Extend the Principles and Structure of the Initial Astute Support Solution Model to Operational Handover (Plus 3 Months) for Each of the 7 Submarines. the Additional 3 Months Post Operational Handover is to Capture any Residual Transition Costs that Fall Beyond the Operational Handover Milestone for Each Submarine. the Astute Support Solution Continues to Mature as Further Experience is Gained from Sea. Both HMS ASTUTE and HMS AMBUSH Have Been Successfully Maintained Through Intensive Trials Periods and Further Action is Underway to Ensure that Appropriate Arrangements are in Place to Support the Submarines as They Progress Towards Operational Deployments.</Th>

<th>approvals Following Whole Astute Programme Approval in 2012, an Annual Information Note is Submitted Each Summer to Provide an Update on Status of the Programme. the 2013 Information Note Was Submitted to IAC 29 July 2013. the Astute Build, Support and Training Programmes Remain Within their Extant Approvals. Boat 1 - HMS ASTUTE. on 25 April 2013, HMS ASTUTE Achieved Operational Handover (the Scheduling Authority Transferred to the Royal Navy). This Was Followed by a Short Maintenance Period to Enable Force Generation Prior to Operational Tasking. HMS ASTUTE is Now Deployed on Operations. Boat 2 - HMS AMBUSH HMS AMBUSH Achieved Operational Handover on 26 June 2013 Following a Maintenance Period at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde, the Submarine Continued with a Second, Capability Proving Sea Trial Phase which Completed at the End of July 2013. the Vessel is Currently Undertaking a Base Maintenance Period Prior to Operational Tasking Later in 2014. Boat 3 - ARTFUL ARTFUL Continues Construction in the Devonshire Dock Hall at Barrow-in-Furness. a Delay in Supply of Key Nuclear Steam Raising Plant Components and a Shortfall in Volume of Construction and Outfit Work Completed Against the Plan Prevented Core Load and Launch from Being Achieved Against the Baseline Milestones. Core Load Eventually Completed in September 2013 and Preparations are in Hand for ARTFUL to Exit the Devonshire Dock Hall and Enter the Water in May 2014. Exit Barrow is Scheduled to Occur Approximately 12 Months after Launch with the Submarine Undertaking a Focussed Sea Trials Package Prior to Operational Handover in Autumn 2015. ARTFUL Was Formally Named on 20 September 2013. Boat 4 - AUDACIOUS Construction and Outfit of AUDACIOUS Continues in the Devonshire Dock Hall, with the Submarine Having Entered the ‘closed Outfit’ Phase in April 2013 (on Completion of the Final Unit Butt-Weld). There Has Been a Significant Increase in Test and Commissioning Activities over the Last 12 Months. Electrical Switch Board Operations Completed in October 2013, While Installation of Thin Flank Array Modules Has Commenced and is Progressing Ahead of Schedule. Forthcoming Milestones Include Commencement of Diesel Generator Trials (May 2014) and Primary Circuit Initial Fill (September 2014). Boat 5 - ANSON ANSON Has Continued Its ‘open Outfit’ Phase with the Largest Unit 6/7 (Accommodation and Command Unit) and the Forward End Construction Having Been Delivered to the Devonshire Dock Hall in September 2013 and December 2013 Respectively. Fabrication of the Aft End Construction Completed in March 2014; this is Currently Undergoing Non-Destructive Examination in the New Assembly Shop. Areas of Focus for the Next 12 Months Include Completion of the Unit 4/5 Butt-Weld by September 2014. Boat 6 - AGAMEMNON AGAMEMNON’s Keel Was Laid in a Formal Ceremony on 18 July 2013 in the Devonshire Dock Hall which Was Attended by Minister (Defence Equipment
&amp; Support). Fabrication Continues in the New Assembly Shop. Boat 7 - Unnamed Procurement of Long Lead Items for Boat 7 Has Commenced. as Reported in MPR 13, the Programme Has Pursued a Number of Opportunities to Batch Buy Materials for Boats 5-7, Delivering Cost Savings to the Programme and Protecting the Later Boats from the Potential Impact of Material Shortfalls; this Opportunity Has Allowed Steel for Boat 7 to be Cut Early in January 2014. ASTUTE CLASS TRAINING SERVICE the Astute Class Training Service (ACTS) Has Continued to Provide Training for Ships Companies of HMS ASTUTE, HMS AMBUSH and ARTFUL. Commercial Agreement Has Been Reached with the Training Service Provider, FAST, to Secure the Necessary Changes to the Service to Allow for the Delivery of Training for Boat 4 Crews from July 2015.</Th>

SUPPORT

The Astute Support Solution Continues to Mature as Further Experience is Gained from Sea Time. Current Focus is to Optimise Support Arrangements to Support HMS Astute Through Her First Operational Deployment and Prepare for HMS Ambush's Deployment Later in 2014.

FOUNDATION CONTRACT

The MOD’s 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) Plan to Save at Least £900m from the Costs of the Submarine Programme to 2021 under the Submarine Enterprise Performance Programme (SEPP), Resulted in a Foundation Contract with BAES M-S Being Signed on 17 July 2013 Committing the Company to a Share of the Total £900m Efficiency Savings, Through Performance Improvement, Totalling at Least £386m over an 8 Year Period.

## A.5. Capability Risks

Delivery of HMS ASTUTE is Critical to the Submarine’s Readiness Profile. HMS ASTUTE’s Delay will Result in the Delayed Introduction of Improved Capability over Current Classes. the Astute Class will also De-Risk Capability Essential for an Affordable Successor Deterrent Programme.

<td Colspan="5">the Initial Astute Support Solution Was Approved in July 2006; it Follows a Traditional Support Model, but Recognises Astute’s Differences and Introduces Additional Arrangements as Appropriate. Provision Has Been Made to Employ the Build Contractor (BAE Systems) as the Astute Technical Authority; MOD will be the Approving Authority, with the Nuclear Propulsion Project Team Responsible for the Nuclear Steam Raising Plant. MOD Equipment Project Teams will Support Specific Equipments with Head of in-Service Submarine (Head of Submarine Production Up to Operational Handover) Maintaining a Platform Focus and Providing the Flotilla Wide Single Point of Contact for Navy Command. Astute Class Maintenance at the Waterfront will be Conducted under Existing Warship Support Modernisation Initiative Arrangements. the Astute Class Training Service is a Private Finance Initiative Contract, Initially Approved for 36 Years to Provide Astute Class Specific Training to the Royal Navy for Boats 1-3. Approval Was Given in 2007, to Extend to a 38 Year Contract, to Cover the Life of Boat 4. Approval for Later Boats will be Considered During FY14/15 as Part of the Option Set for the Delivery of a Coherent Training Solution Led by Submarine Training Capability Programme. the Revised Approach Was Included as Part of the Whole Programme Approval in June 2011. MPR13 Reports Against the Astute Support Solution Approved by HM Treasury in May 2012. the Principles and Funding to the Initial Support Solution is Provided by the Submarine Production Team and Transfers to in-Service Project Teams at an Appropriate Point.</Td>
