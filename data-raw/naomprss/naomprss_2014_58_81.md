# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Team Complex Weapons initiative is based on meeting the UK's enduring requirement to have battle winning military capability through the use of Complex Weapons; to be assured that the weapons will perform as expected; and to retain the ability to develop leading edge Complex Weapons technologies. Within this context, the initiative aims to deliver:

1.  Improved, adaptable and flexible Complex Weapons (Missiles and associated systems) that can be shaped to meet current and future military capability needs;

2.  Freedom of Action and Operational Advantage in our Complex Weapons through a sustained indigenous industrial construct.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

In April 2008 an Initial Gate submission was made to the Investment Approvals Board for the Complex Weapons Sector. This was approved in June 2008. The Business Case sought approval to enter a noncompetitive Assessment Phase with Team Complex Weapons. The Assessment Phase was designed to test the viability of UK Sovereign acquisition of Complex Weapons through a modular and funding pipeline approach that offered greater value for money. This was consistent with the Defence Industrial Strategy in maintaining operational sovereignty of UK Complex Weapons and sustaining UK industry's specialist capabilities.

Initial work considered a number of options, ranging from non-competitive based around Team Complex Weapons, to full open competition. The options were assessed on their ability to meet military capability, operational sovereignty and value for money measured against the draft Concept of Analysis. The analysis strongly indicated that the continued use of competition would progressively erode the MOD's ability to secure affordable and effective military capability and restrict future choice and decision making.

## A.3. Project History

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>The Team Complex Weapons proposition is founded on the Defence Industrial Strategy that set out the UK's intent to preserve operational sovereignty of its Complex Weapons. The first step in assessing the viability of a UK sovereign acquisition was a non-competitive Assessment Phase which was approved by the Investment Approvals Board (Initial Gate June 2008). This covered risk reduction work to develop solutions to meet the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (FASGW), Loitering Munition;
Storm Shadow Capability Enhancement Programme (SSCEP); Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS); and Selected Precision Effects at Range (SPEAR) programmes. Review Note 1 (March 2009) sought approval of a second tranche of money to continue the Assessment Phase and Review Note 2 (November 2009) sought approval for funds to conclude the Assessment Phase and to address the questions raised by the Investment Approvals Board (July/October 2009). The Assessment Phase concluded that the preferred option was a long term partnering model based on bilateral arrangements with the Team Complex Weapons Prime Contractors. With the Strategic Defence Review on the horizon Interim Main Gate 1 (March 2010) proposed entering into a shorter term Interim Portfolio Management Agreement (PMA-I) with MBDA UK. It also sought approval for expenditure to meet only immediate Complex Weapons requirements specifically:
Loitering Munition (Fire Shadow) (Demonstration &amp;
Manufacture);
SPEAR Capability 2 Block 1 (Demonstration &amp; Manufacture) (now Brimstone 2);
Future Local Area Air Defence System (Assessment Phase);
SPEAR Capability 2 Block 2 (now Spiral Development) (Assessment Phase); and SPEAR Capability 3 (Assessment Phase)</th>

Brimstone 2

Significant technical issues (e.g. propellant cracking and liner de-bonding) on the Vulcan rocket motor, manufactured by Roxel, were discovered in January 2012. In the following March a Red Team review commenced which increased confidence in the Roxel solution passing the testing environment and achieving first use capability by November 2015. To monitor Roxel's progress a series of Risk Gate reviews were established, which was a prerequisite before seeking Investment Approvals Committee Approval for the programme.

In order to mitigate the risk on operations in Afghanistan and other potential operations, resulting from the delay to the programme, the Defence Board approved a Decision Point 2 Option for a further buy of Dual Mode Seeker (non Insensitive Munition) Brimstone missiles. This additional buy was jointly funded by MOD and MBDA UK Ltd.

Sea Ceptor

The Main Gate Business Case for FLAADS Maritime Demonstration Phase (Interim Main Gate 2) was submitted to the IAC in April 2011 and was approved in December 2011. FLAADS Maritime was later officially named Sea Ceptor and is referred to as such throughout the PSS.

Seeker Critical Design Review was held on 22 August 2012 with the Defence Science and Technology

Laboratory which demonstrated seeker readiness for air carriage trials. A Guided Firing Readiness

Review (Significant Milestone) was conducted on 27 June 2012 and the deliverable was accepted by the Project Team by 30 September 2012. Critical Design Review commenced on 19 March 2013 with performance aspects completed in the second half of 2013.

The MBDA schedule risk analysis conducted in February 2013 concluded that the 50% date for T23 Full

Operating Capability In Service Date in 2016 was within 3 weeks of the approved baseline. The Project Team conducted risk mitigation and further analysis in order to close this variance. MBDA’s project schedule has been refined from 2,000 to 8,000 lines of detail since April 2011, as part of routine Demonstration Phase business, bringing significantly greater granularity to task elements.

Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon

Interim Main Gate 3 was the third of the submissions and concerned approval for the Future Anti-Surface

Guided Weapon (Heavy) Demonstration and Manufacture Phase. The Business Case was presented to

Equipment Capability Secretariat on 9 January 2012 and was considered by the Investment Approvals Committee on 18 January. On 31 January Director General Finance approved the case, with a caveat that negotiations should be concluded with France before 31 March 2012. Bi-laterals continued, but by 28 March when Chief Secretary to the Treasury wrote to the MOD, discussions had not been concluded and as such Chief Secretary to the Treasury approved the case, subject to receiving French national approval. Approval from France was not immediately forthcoming and the Project sought reapproval.

## A.4. In-Year Progress

Brimstone 2

The Brimstone 2 programme has made significant progress in year. Development trials to demonstrate flight software and seeker improvements successfully took place in the United States during SeptemberOctober 2013; the seeker and flight software development work is now complete. The trial was a key demonstration of capability and achieved direct hits on a variety of static and moving targets. Later in the year the first Tornado firing using the Roxel Insensitive Munition rocket motor was accomplished at Aberporth. Qualification of both energetic sub-systems (warhead and rocket motor) continue to progress without any failures and the rocket motor has now passed the previous failure points. This evidence, along with substantial supporting investigations and reports, has led to the satisfactory closure of the Rocket Motor Recovery Programme that was enacted after the initial technical issues in January 2012.

Sea Ceptor (Demonstration and Manufacture)

The two planned Instrument Firings of the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile were completed successfully in April 2013. Approval of the Manufacture Phase and contract award with MBDA were achieved in September 2013. The Critical Design Review was completed in November 2013.

Future Local Area Air Defence System (Land) Initial Gate

The FLAADS (Land) Initial Gate Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approvals Committee (IAC) in October 2013 and was approved by the IAC on 21 January 2014. Subsequently an amendment was made to the Through Life Enabling Contract to include this tranche of work with MBDA.

Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy)

The FASGW(H)/ANL (Anti Navire Léger (Light Anti Ship)) Concept and Assessment Phase concluded in December 2011 and following UK Approval to proceed to the Demonstration and Manufacture it was anticipated that a contract for FASGW(H) Demonstration and Manufacture would be let in Quarter 1 of 2012. However, owing to a change of Government in France, a Strategic Defence and Security Review

(termed “Livre Blanc”) was initiated resulting in France withdrawing its immediate support to

FASGW(H)/ANL pending the outcome of the “Livre Blanc” process. Consequently the FASGW(H)/ANL

Demonstration and Manufacture contract was not placed with the prime contractor MBDA. The “Livre Blanc” process concluded in April 2013 and France confirmed its commitment to the FASGW(H)/ANL project. Following a period of intense negotiations a contract was placed with MBDA for the Joint Programme on 26 March 2014.

Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Light)

The FASGW(L) Demonstration and Manufacture Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approvals Committee on 15 October 2013. On 23 January 2014 the case was approved by Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Contractual negotiations are still ongoing with Thales.

Brimstone Support USE

The Business Case for the continuation of the Brimstone In-Service Support phase was submitted on 17 September 2013 to Head of Defence Portfolio & Approvals Secretariat and approved on 3 October 2013. A five year contract was let in the same month. This included a short transition period with Full Service delivered from June 2014.

## A.5. Capability Risks

Interim Main Gate 1

Brimstone 2 - replaces the legacy Brimstone missile's energetics and airframe with a new Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliant warhead, rocket motor and an upgraded seeker and airframe. Brimstone 2 will replace the Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone capability currently in service with the Royal Air Force and will be integrated onto Tornado GR4 and is intended for integration on Typhoon. Spear Capability 3 is a new 100kg class weapon. This capability will be the primary air-to-ground armament for the Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA)/F-35B Joint Strike Fighter from 2022, and optimised for internal carriage. Spear Capability 3 will provide the means to destroy/defeat a wide range of targets at range, including mobile and relocatable targets, in all weathers day and night, in complex environments under tight Rules of Engagement.

Sea Ceptor

Sea Ceptor will provide increased capability over Sea Wolf that addresses the capability shortfall identified in the 2009 Capability Above Water capability audits. Sea Ceptor is the only candidate to fill the capability gap that is both affordable and will meet the Key User Requirements within the required timescales.

Future Local Area Air Defence System (Land) – is planned to replace the Rapier ground based air defence capability at its Out-Service-Date at the end of the decade.

Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy) and (Light)

FASGW will provide the Royal Navy with a missile enabling the Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft (SCMR), the Wildcat HMA Mk 2, to complete its full range of intended missions against target sets in the maritime and littoral environments. FASGW(H) will replace current capability provided by Lynx Mk 8 helicopters armed with Sea Skua missiles and FASGW(L) will address a deficit in the current anti-surface capability. \\\

Brimstone USE

Brimstone is currently supported by MBDA UK and other contractors under a limited scope of In Service Support activities and a Contractor Logistic Support contract which expires on 30 September 13. The existing support solution for Brimstone is insufficient to meet the revised requirements and as such, the expiry of the current support contract is seen as an opportunity to revise the support arrangements to meet the updated requirement. Contracting for the In Service Support requirement with MBDA represents an opportunity to transition to a full Asset Availability Service support solution. It addresses the lessons learned during operations in Libya to deliver greater availability at appropriate readiness levels to the user by transitioning support to the contractor.

This aims to secure financial benefits across the Programme in the in-service support of Weapons Systems. This will be achieved through common approaches, methods and tools, common requirements and the re-structuring of how support is delivered in industry. Brimstone is the first project that has been contracted using the Unified Support Environment approach, with Storm Shadow and Advanced Short Range Air to Air Missile (ASRAAM) to follow in Financial Year 14/15.

Original definition: The project will deliver 25 safe and useful munitions in March 2012 (50%). These will form a start-up capability for current operations. MPR 2012 definition: These definitions are not applicable yet given the incremental acquisition approach. In Service Date and Initial Operating Capability would likely occur in later increments and be subject to definition and approvals at an appropriate time. However, an initial batch of weapons systems was delivered, on time, in March 2012. These were demonstrated in June 2012 and while the success rate was lower than desired, performance of the hardware met the Fire Shadow key performance measures. Reason for change: The Senior Responsible Owner took a decision not to deploy the weapon for testing in Afghanistan as the capability was not sufficiently mature. It could therefore not meet its In-Service Date for use in Afghanistan so it has been re-defined.

Technical Factors

In March 2011 Dual Mode Seeker

Brimstone assets were deployed

on operations in Libya. This

significantly increased the

assumed consumption rate, due to

an increase in operational firings

and Air Carriage Hours. Given this

increased consumption and

assuming current consumption

rates on operations in Afghanistan,

the current stockpile of Dual Mode

Seeker Brimstone will be

exhausted by March 2014. This,

combined with the currently

estimated 24 month slip to the

Brimstone 2 project, leaves the

Royal Air Force with a capability

gap until the planned end of UK

commitment to operations in

Afghanistan in December 2014. It

also leaves the UK with a gap on

any potential near-term contingent

operations, which require a low

collateral, precision strike

capability.

As a result of these emerging

capability gaps, a Decision Point 2

option, to provide \\\ Dual Mode

Seeker Brimstone, was considered

\[

and approved\] by the Defence

Board on 19 October 2012.

This

additional buy was jointly funded

by MOD and MBDA UK Ltd.
