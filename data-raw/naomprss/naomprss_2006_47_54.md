# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

CIP Comprises Three Closely Interrelated Projects Procured as a Single Entity via the Bowman Prime Contractor. Common Battlefield Application Toolset (ComBAT) is a Set of Common Software Tools Delivering a Battle Management System to Aid Operational Planning and Control and Enhancing Situational Awareness.

Digitization of the Battlespace Land (DBL) Infrastructure Builds on the Bowman Communications and Information System Providing Hardware and Software in Support of Headquarters to Optimise the Use of Information and Enable Interoperabilty with National and International Systems.

Platform Battlefield Information Systems Application (PBISA) Integrates ComBAT with Other Systems and Sensors to Optimise the Effectiveness of Key Armoured Fighting Vehicles (Such as the Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank). It Includes a Set of Common Software Tools Delivering a Battle Management System, Integrated to Optimise the Fightability of Key Armoured Platforms, and Enabling the Concurrent Operation of Other Software Applications.

In August 2001 the Assessment Phase Contract Was Let to General Dynamics UK, the Bowman Preferred Supplier., to Manage the Technical Risk of Integrating CIP with Bowman and Achieve Value for Money. Following Main Gate Approval in October 2002 the Supply and Support of CIP Was Added to the Bowman Contract, 15 Months after the Award of the Bowman Contract in December 2002.

The Main Gate Approval Recognised that CIP Would be Fielded in Three Capability Increments Between 2004 and 2006 to Manage the Inherent Risks Attached to the Fielding of a Large and Complex Programme in a Single Stage. Although the Approved in Service Date (ISD) Was December 2004, a Demanding Target of March 2004 Was Set to Introduce the Initial Capability Increment Coincident with the Delivery of Bowman. Extensive Testing Involving ComBAT and DBL Infrastructure (Culminating in the Bowman Operational Field Trials in March 2004) Indicated that more Work Was Required to Deliver the Initial Capability. Based on Evidence Gathered During a Further Brigade Scale Operational Field Trial, CIP Was Granted Initial System Acceptance in December 2004. in Service Date (ISD) Was Achieved in December 2005.

As a Consequence, Limited CIP Functionality (Limited Automated Position Reporting and Data Message Transfer Capability) Has Been Deployed to Support Operation TELIC in Iraq Since April 2005. Continued Operational Experience in Iraq Indicates that CIP is Delivering a Battle Winning Capability. However, Recognition of the Inextricable Linkage Between Bowman and CIP Provided the Opportunity to Undertake a Programmatic, Technical and Risk Review to Better Ensure that the Combined Programmes Would Deliver a Coherent, Stable and Minimum Capability Consistent with the MOD’s Vision of Achieving Network Enabled Capability. the Outcome of this Review Now Forms the Basis for Completing the Demonstration and Manufacture (D&M) Phase of the CIP (and Bowman) Contract. to Improve Affordability and Reduce Risk, the Planned Third Capability Increment, Including Delivery of a Common Information System (COInS), Has Been Removed, and the Validity of Proceeding with it under a Future Programme is Being Reviewed Separately.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

CIP Started Life as Three Separate Projects.

The Assessment Phase Was Conducted in Two Stages: a Limited Initial Assessment Phase (LIAP) and a Main Assessment Phase (MAP).

LIAP Was Aimed at Defining the Technology Gap Between the Bowman System Capability and the ComBAT and DBL Infrastructure Capability Requirements, and How CIP Could be Brought into Alignment with the Bowman Programme. It Was also Intended to Confirm the Procurement Strategy for PBISA. Additional Assessments of Who Should be Responsible for Developing and Delivering the PBISA Solution Favoured the Bowman Prime Contractor over the Platform Design Authorities.

The MAP Built Upon the Output of the LIAP with the Aim of Recommending a Single Solution for Each of the CIP Projects to Satisfy Customer Requirements, Whilst Offering Value for Money at an Acceptable Risk. Through Two Stages, Option Analysis and System Design, the MAP Identified Options to Fill the Gaps Identified in the LIAP. This Was Achieved by the Prime Contractor Undertaking a Competitive Subcontract Down Selection Process, the Results of which Were Presented for MOD Endorsement.

The Assessment Phase Concluded that it Was Possible to Align the CIP and Bowman Projects with the Optimal Procurement Strategy Being to Let the CIP Supply and Support Contract as a Non-Competitive Amendment to the Bowman Contract. Despite the Significant Risks of Attempting to Align CIP with Bowman Fifteen Months after the Award of the Bowman Contract, Harmonisation of the Bowman and CIP in Service Dates Was Considered Essential to Meet Time, Cost and Performance Requirements and Avoid Converting Vehicles Twice, for Bowman and then CIP, at Nugatory Cost. This Strategy Was Endorsed at Main Gate. an Extension of the Bowman Contract for CIP Was Agreed with General Dynamics UK in December 2002.
