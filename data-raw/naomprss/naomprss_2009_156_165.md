# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Following UK Participation in the Concept Demonstration Phase of the Programme, the United States

Joint Strike Fighter Was Selected to Meet the Joint Combat Aircraft Requirement. the Strategic Defence Review Confirmed this Requirement to Provide the UK with a Replacement for the Royal Navy Sea Harrier and the Royal Air Force Harrier GR7/9. a Tailored Main Gate Demonstration Approval Was Obtained in January 2001 for Participation in the System Development and Demonstration Phase to the Value of £1,300m, along with
£600m for Related Non-System Development and Demonstration Work, Leading to Signature that Month by UK and United States Governments of the System Development and Demonstration Memorandum of Understanding. the Selection of Lockheed Martin as the Joint Strike Fighter Air System Prime Contractor Included a Teaming Agreement with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to Collectively Form Team Joint Strike Fighter. Two Separate and Competitive Propulsion Contracts Were Awarded to Pratt and Witney for the F135 Engine and General Electric/Rolls Royce Fighter Engine Team for the F136 Engine. Whilst Other Partners Joined the Programme at Level 2 and 3 Entry Arrangements, Only United States and UK Requirements Drive the System Development and Demonstration Baseline Solution.

In September 2002 the UK Selected the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Joint Strike Fighter Variant to Meet Our Requirement. a Review of the Joint Strike Fighter Programme and the Viability of the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Design Was Completed in January 2005 and Concluded that a Successful Programme of Weight Reduction Initiatives and Other Performance Enhancements Had Restored Confidence that the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Design Should Remain the UK’s Planning Assumption. a Further Review by the Investment Approvals Board in July 2006 Confirmed this Decision.

On 12 December 2006 Minister of State for Defence Procurement Signed the Production Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding Representing the First of Four Further Main Gates Planned for the Introduction of Joint Combat Aircraft into Service. the UK Has Approval for Phase 2 of the Joint Combat Aircraft Incremental Strategy where the UK will Participate in the Joint Initial Operational Test &
Evaluation with the United States. This will Allow the UK to Continue to Influence all Aspects of the Joint Strike Fighter Programme as it Moves into a New Phase.

Two Key Performance Measures Remain at Risk:

KPM04 - Mission Performance: In July 2006 the Investment Approvals Board Directed that Ship-Borne Rolling and Vertical Landing Should be Included in Future Development of the Joint Combat Aircraft Design to Mitigate the Risk to the Vertical Land Bring Back Capability.

KPM06 – Logistic Footprint: Performance Remains Marginally Better than Requirement, Although Due to Very Narrow Margin this KUR Remains at Risk. Work is Ongoing with Lockheed Martin to Drive Down Logistic Footprint to Ensure it Remains Within Specification as the Air System Matures Throughout the System Development and Demonstration Phase.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Approval Was Obtained in November 1996 to Enter the Concept Demonstration Phase on the Joint Strike Fighter Programme under a Memorandum of Understanding Signed in December 1995. the Phase Began in November 1996 with Two Competing United States Prime Contractors (Boeing and Lockheed Martin) Designing Weapons Systems and Flying Demonstration Aircraft on which the Selection of the Preferred Bidder Was Based. the Phase Completed in October 2001 with the Announcement of Lockheed Martin as the Successful Bidder. Studies into Alternative Options to Joint Strike Fighter to Meet the Requirement Were also Conducted but Were Rejected on Cost Effective Grounds. the Options Were US F/A18E Aircraft, French Rafale M, a “navalised” Eurofighter and an Advanced Harrier.

## A.3. Progress

The Flight Test Programme is Progressing with the First Conventional Take Off and Landing and the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Variants Achieving First Flight and in Excess of 70 Plus Test Flights to Date. the UK Has Received Certification, Supported by Analysis from the United States and Other Independent Subject Matter Experts, that the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Propulsion System is Approved to Fly Throughout the Current Design Environment (Conventional and Vertical). on 18 March 2009 the UK Secretary of State for Defence Announced the Approval for the UK to Purchase Three Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Variants of Joint Strike Fighters which will Allow the UK to Participate in the Operational Test and Evaluation of Joint Strike Fighter along with the United States Services.

## A.4. Capability Risks

This Capability Provides the UK with an Expeditionary Air to Ground and Air to Air Capability to Satisfy the Strategic Defence Review of 1998 in Order to Maintain the Carrier Strike Capability for the UK. Without this Capability the UK will not Have the Ability to Launch Air Power from both Land and Sea at a Time and Place of Our Choosing.

The Short Take Off Element of KPM 04 (Based on Invincible Class Carriers not Future Aircraft Carrier) will be Changed in the Ongoing KPM Review, Although Current Projections Indicate Robust Short Take Off Performance from Future Aircraft Carrier. Weight Challenges and Propulsion System Integration Issues Place the Vertical Landing Bring Back Element of KPM 04 at Increased Risk; the Integrated Project Team Has Commenced Programme Action to Amend the System Development and Demonstration Contract to Satisfy a Requirement to Undertake Shipborne Rolling Vertical Landing.
