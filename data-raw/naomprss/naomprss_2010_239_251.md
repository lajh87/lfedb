Trials Concluded in Israel in March 2009. the Watchkeeper Training Facility at 32 Regiment, Larkhill Was Commissioned in September 2009. Automatic Take Off & Landing System Maturity Flights Were Concluded During Stage 3 Flight Trials During November 2009. the Programme Has Experienced Technical Issues where the Automatic Take Off & Landing System Software Development and Integration Have Impacted the Programme Timescales. Also, the Necessary Safety and Airworthiness Evidence Needed for Stage 4 Flight Trials Has Delayed UK Test and Evaluations at Parc Aberporth in South Wales. Watchkeeper Initial Contractor Logistic Support Contract Was Signed January 2010.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Watchkeeper Replaces the Capability Previously Provided by Phoenix Unmanned Air Vehicle which Reached It’s Out of Service Date in April 2008. the Hermes 450 Unmanned Air Vehicle Has Been Contracted on a Service Based Provision to Provide Continued Capability and Cover an Urgent Operational Requirement in Iraq and Afghanistan Prior to Watchkeeper Being Delivered into Service, this Has Subsequently Moved to a UOR in Afghanistan. if the Capability is not Acquired, UK Forces in Multi National Division (South East) will Face a Critical Shortfall in the Provision of Formation Level Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition & Reconnaissance.

The Option Was Taken to Use the Existing Grass Strip at Upavon Rather than Build a Purpose Built Runway for Watchkeeper. Repetitive Use of a Grass Strip During Take-Off and Landing, Whilst Training, will Increase Air Vehicle Fatigue. Regular Deployment to an Airfield with a Hardened Strip and Adjacent Range Facilities Such as Boscombe Down or Aberporth is Planned to Minimise this Impact.

The Requirement to Disseminate Watchkeeper Product Across the Battlespace Has Grown Beyond the Capacity of Bowman. There is Now a Need to Interoperate with the Deployed UK Core Network (Defence Information Infrastructure Future Deployed, Defence Information Infrastructure Current Deployed, Falcon, Cormorant, Reacher) to Allow Exploitation via the Dabinett Program and Urgent Operational Requirements that will Provide Early Capability Such as Attacker. This is Put at Risk by Dependency on Other Programmes as Well as a Required Change to the Watchkeeper Approach to Exchange of Information. the Need to Ensure that Watchkeeper Full Motion Video will be Accessible by Remote Video Terminal Users is Being Addressed by a Planning Round Enhancement Option to Achieve Initial Delivery by the Forth Quarter of 2010.

Current Status of Projects

• Support Contract - Airborne STand Off Radar

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Airborne STand Off Radar Provides a Long-Range all-Weather Theatre Surveillance and Target Acquisition System, Capable of Detecting Moving, Fixed and Static Targets. It is Designed to Meet a Joint Army and RAF Requirement. the System Comprises a Fleet of Five Air Platforms, Each with a Radar Sensor, and Eight Ground Stations. There is a Planned Mid-Life Update from 2015/2016 Onwards.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

In 1989 a Technology Demonstration Programme Worth £12m (at 1999/2000 Prices) Was Agreed with MOD Research Establishments which are Now Incorporated in QinetiQ. This Feasibility Work Ran for Two Years and Demonstrated that the Concepts Used in Airborne STand Off Radar Were Practicable. a Move into Project Definition Was Approved in September 1993. This is Now Deemed to be the Equivalent of Initial Gate.

Following Open Competition, Two Parallel Contracts for an 18 Month Project Definition Programme Were Let in February 1995. After Assessment of the Project Definition Proposals it Was Considered that the Optimum Solution Would be to Invite the Two Consortia to Submit Best and Final Offers for the Development, Production and in-Service Support. This Revised Procurement Strategy Was Approved by the then Minister for Defence Procurement in March 1997.

During the Preparation of Invitations to the Two Project Definition Consortia to Submit Best and Final Offers in September 1997, Programming Decisions Were Taken which Delayed the Availability of Funding, Particularly in the Early Years. as a Result the Planned in Service Date for the Airborne STand Off Radar Capability Was Delayed by 15 Months. During the Best and Final Offer Phase, a Decision Was Taken to Consider a Third Bid Based Upon the US Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System Upgrade Programme Known as the Radar Technology Insertion Programme. as a Result Various Unsolicited Revisions to the Bids Were Received During the Assessment Process, Further Delaying the Planned in Service Date by 14 Months. Approval for the Implementation Phase Was Given after Down Selection in June 1999.

## A.3. Progress

The Prime Contract Was Awarded to Raytheon Systems Limited in December 1999 for the Full Demonstration and Manufacture of the System. the Contract also Covers the Provision of Ten Years Contractor Logistic Support. All Five Air Platforms and Eight Ground Stations Have Been Delivered to the User and the in Service Date Was Achieved in November 2008. Airborne STand Off Radar is Currently in Theatre Supporting Operation Herrick.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Loss of the Capability Provided by Airborne STand Off Radar Project Team Would Remove the UK’s Ability to Conduct Long-Range all-Weather Theatre Surveillance and Target Acquisition Against Mobile,
