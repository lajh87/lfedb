# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Requirement for the Queen Elizabeth Class Was Endorsed in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review which Identified a Continuing Need for Rapidly Deployable Forces with the Reach and Self-Sufficiency to Act Independently of Host-Nation Support. the Strategic Defence Review Concluded that the Ability to Deploy Offensive Air Power Would be Central to Future Force Projection Operations, with Carriers Able to Operate the Largest Possible Range of Aircraft in the Widest Possible Range of Roles. This Analysis Was Further Endorsed by the New Chapter Work of 2002 and the Defence White Paper in December 2003. the Current Invincible Class of Carriers Was Designed for Cold War Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations. with Helicopters and a Limited Airdefence Capability Provided by a Relatively Small Number of Embarked Sea Harriers, it Was Judged that this Capability Would No Longer Meet Future United Kingdom Requirements. It Was Therefore Decided to Replace the Invincible Class with Two Larger and more Capable Aircraft Carriers. the Class’s Offensive Air Power will be Provided Primarily by the Joint Combat Aircraft. the Joint Force Air Group is an Air Group Comprising of a Mix of Aircraft, Tailored to the Mission Need;
it will Typically Consist of both Fixed and Rotary-Winged Aircraft Including Joint Air Assets E.g. Joint Combat Aircraft.

The Strategic Defence & Security Review Confirmed the Requirement for a Carrier Strike Capability as Part of MOD’s Future Force 2020. in Order to Deliver Overall Savings to Defence, it Concluded that the Carrier Strike Component Would be Based Around the Carrier Variant of the Joint Strike Fighter which Would Fly from an Operational Queen Elizabeth Class Carrier Converted to a Carrier Variant Configuration (Fitted with Catapults and Arrestor Gear). the Strategic Defence &
Security Review Confirmed that both Carriers Should be Built, with One to be Operational and the Second Kept in Extended Readiness or Sold. the Future of the Non-Converted Carrier is Likely to be a Matter for the Strategic Defence & Security Review 2015.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

The Class Received Initial Gate Approval in December 1998 and Invitations to Tender Were Issued in January 1999. Following Tender Evaluation, Competitive Firm Price Contracts for the Assessment Phase, Each Potentially Worth some £30m, Were Awarded to BAE Systems and Thales UK in November 1999. Initially, the Assessment Phase Was Broken Down into Two Stages. the First Involved the Examination of Several Carrier Designs, and Helped Inform the Decision in January 2001 to Select the United States Joint Strike Fighter as the Option with Best Potential to Meet the Joint Combat Aircraft Requirement. Stage 1 Completed in June 2001, Following which Proposals from the Contractors for Stage 2 Were Considered, Together with an Assessment of their Views on the Level of Work Needed to Adequately De-Risk the Programme. After Careful Consideration, the Conclusion Was Reached that the Original Two-Stage Approach No Longer Offered Value for Money and the Assessment Phase Strategy Was Changed.

The Competitive Second Stage Was Revised and Shortened (Completing in November 2002) and Enabled the Competing Contractors to Concentrate on Refining their Designs and Taking Key Trade-Off Decisions. an Innovative Continuous Assessment Process Was Used Throughout to Evaluate the Contractors' Performance which Led to the Conclusion that an Alliance Approach Involving BAE Systems, Thales UK and the Department Represented the Best Approach to Future Aircraft Carrier. the Innovative Alliance Procurement Strategy Enabled the Full Exploitation of the Resources and Strengths of the Alliance Participants with the Shared Objective of Improving on Agreed Performance Targets and Was Announced in January 2003. a Third Stage of Assessment Was Therefore Taken Forward on this Basis to Further Increase the Maturity of the Design and Determine the Alliancing Strategy for Future Aircraft Carrier. Stage 3 Completed in March 2004.

In July 2004, the Assessment Phase Was Extended into Stage 4 to Further Mature the Design and Carry Out Risk Reduction Work, to Ensure that the Best Technical & Procurement Solution Was Achieved. Alliancing Principles Were Agreed with BAE Systems and Thales UK and Further Developed with the Selection in February 2005 of Kellogg, Brown & Root UK Ltd as an Additional Participant in the Alliance. the Timescale for Completing the Design and Risk Reduction Work Was Further Extended in August 2005 (into Stage 5) Although this Did not Result in any Additional Cost to the Programme. the Assessment Phase Completed at the End of January 2006 and Was Finalised in November 2010, on Receipt of Final Cost Certificates, at a Revised Total Cost of £288m.

Following Direction from the Investment Approvals Board, the Project Has Adopted an Incremental Approach to Main Gate Approval with the Demonstration and Manufacturing Phases Being Divided into Two Sequential Main Gate Approval Points. the First Phase (Demonstration), which Included Expanding the Alliance to Include Babcock Engineering Services and VT Shipbuilding, Was Approved by the Investment Approvals Board and Treasury in December 2005. the Total Cost of the Demonstration Phase (Excluding Indirect Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit, but Including Non Recoverable VAT) Was Approved at £297m (not to Exceed). the Demonstration Phase Activity Completed in Mid 2008 with Total Expenditure to 31st March 2011 of £266m. the Second and Final Main Gate Approval, to Proceed with the Manufacturing Phase of the Project Was Announced by Secretary of State on 25th July 2007 at a not to Exceed Cost of £3900m Including the Capitalised Assessment Phase Costs and Demonstration Phase Costs. in March 2006, the UK Agreed a Memorandum of Understanding that Provides for the Supply to France of a Common Baseline Design Data Pack to Enable French Industry to Bid for the Design, Manufacture and Support of One Future Aircraft Carrier (France). France Has Paid an Initial Entry Fee and Contributed to the Costs of the UK Demonstration Phase. at the Time of the Main Gate in 2007, the Build Strategy Called for One of the Lower Blocks to be Constructed at the BAE Systems Submarines Yard in Barrow-in-Furness. BAE Systems Needed to Build a New Facility -
The Central Assembly Shop - In Order to Accommodate the Construction of the Block. It Was Envisaged at the Time that the Facility Would also be Beneficial to the Future Submarine Programme. MOD Authorised BAE Systems to Begin Site Work in June 2007. in July 2008 the Alliance Management Board Agreed to the Reallocation of Lower Block 3 to the A&amp;P Tyne Yard on a ‘best for Project’ Basis and in December 2008 the Aircraft Carrier Alliance Formally Instructed BAE Systems to Terminate the Contract and Fully Justify any Incurred Costs. It Was Hoped that the Work Carried Out in Barrow Would be of Use to the Future Submarine Programme, However this Did not Come to Fruition which Led to a Write-Off of £8m in Financial Year 2009-10. Following Main Gate Approval the Project Moved into the Engineering Transition Phase, an Extension of the Demonstration Phase to Encompass the Period Prior to Contract Signature. on 3rd July 2008 a Contract Was Signed with BVT Surface Fleet for the Manufacture of the Two Carriers Together with Signature of an Alliance Agreement with all Members of the Alliance. on 11 December 2008, Ministers Announced the Outcome of MOD’s Equipment Examination Including the Intention to Re-Profile the Queen Elizabeth Class Project to Meet Near Term Priorities and Improve the Scope of

<sup>enter Text Here</Sup>alignment with the Joint Combat Aircraft Programme. the Re-Profiling Measure Removed £450m from Years 1 to 4 and Delayed in-Service Dates by 1 and 2 Years. the Cost Estimates of the Impact of the Examination on the Project Were Approved by the MOD in February 2010.

The First Cut of Steel Took Place in July 2009 at the Govan Shipyard in Glasgow, and Manufacture is Underway in Six UK Shipyards: Babcock Rosyth and Appledore, BAE System Surface Ships, Govan, Portsmouth, Cammell Laird Birkenhead and A&amp;P Tyne. in 2009 a Number of Significant Milestones Were Achieved: Completion of No.1 Dock at Rosyth; Delivery of an Upper Deck Section from Appledore to Rosyth; Delivery of the Highly Mechanised Weapon Handling System and the Delivery of Emergency Diesel Generators. at the Close of the Financial Year in March 2010 the Bow of the Queen Elizabeth Departed from Appledore for Rosyth. the Aircraft Carrier Alliance Acknowledged that There Was a Requirement to Reduce Costs at the Time of Contract Award on the Basis that Concerted Management Action in the Early Years of the Project Would Allow this to Reduce. in the Event, the Disruption Caused by Initial Recosting Activity and then the Equipment Examination Prevented Successful Delivery of the Originally Planned Cost Reduction - As this Would not be Achieved, MoD Considered it Prudent to Formally Recognise this in Its Revised Estimate. During 2010 Diesel Generators Were Installed in Lower Block 02 (Portsmouth) and in March 2011 in Lower Block 04 (Govan) on HMS Queen Elizabeth. in Early 2011, the Goliath Crane, which will be Used to Assemble the Carriers, Arrived at Rosyth and is Now Undergoing Preparations for Erection and Commissioning in the Summer.

The Investment Approvals Board Approved the Queen Elizabeth Class Final Target Cost for the Pre-Strategic Defence & Security Review Programme on 31 January 2011 to £5242m, which Has Provided a Stable Cost and Schedule Baseline for the Programme Going Forward. Long-Lead Equipments for HMS Prince of Wales Have Been Ordered over the Last Four Years, with many of the Major Components Already in-Build or Delivered (E.g. Diesel Generators).

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Class Is, Together with Joint Combat Aircraft, Maritime Airborne Surveillance & Control and Military Afloat Reach Sustainability, an Essential Element of the Carrier Enabled Power Projection Programme:
The Ability to Project Air Power from the Sea and Capable of Projecting the Full Level of Medium Scale Offensive Air Effort and Precision Strike from the Sea. Medium Scale is Defined as a Deployment of Brigade-Size or Equivalent for Warfighting or Other Operations. an Example Would be Our Contribution to the NATO-Led Intervention Force in Bosnia.

Joint Combat Aircraft Maritime Capability Depends on the Queen Elizabeth Class to Achieve Carrier Strike.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review Stated that "The Current, Limited Carrier-Strike Capability will be Retired" Because"
Short-Range Harriers ... Would Provide Only a Very Limited Coercive Capability. We Judge it Unlikely that this Would be Sufficiently Useful in the Latter Half of the Decade to be a Cost-Effective Use of Defence Resources". This will Create a Capability Gap until a Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier Has Completed Integration with the First Operational Squadron of Joint Combat Aircraft.

The Strategic Defence & Security Review 2010 Accepted a Capability Gap in the Operation of Fixed Wing Aircraft from 2011 to 2020. This Has Resulted in a Risk to the Re-Generation of this Element of Carrier Enabled Power Projection, which is Being Addressed by Work Across Multiple Defence Lines of Development, Including the Analysis of the Experience Gained from the US and French Navies.

The Reduced Availability of the Queen Elizabeth Class Platform as a Result of the Strategic Defence & Security Review Decision to Operate a Single Carrier may (Depending on Future Decisions) Reduce the Availability of this Element of Carrier Enabled Power Projection, Although this Could be Offset by Conversion of the Second Hull or Close Cooperation with the French Navy.

<td>the Aircraft Carrier Alliance Continues to Work to Build Strategy 5, which Was First Announced in March 2009 Following the Equipment Examination. as Part of the Final Target Cost Analysis, the Aircraft Carrier Alliance Have Revisited their Monte-Carlo Analysis not Only in Terms of Cost but also Schedule. Risk and Uncertainty Assumptions Around Integration, Commissioning and Trials Have Been Updated and Fully Aligned to Those Used for Costing of Final Target Cost. Analysis that both the Project Team and Cost Assurance &amp; Analysis Services Support Suggests that Contract Acceptance Dates for the Two Queen Elizabeth Class Vessels Should Now be June 2016 for Queen Elizabeth and September 2018 for Prince of Wales. Allowing for Transition from Contract Acceptance Date to in Service Date Gives a Revised in Service Dates as October 2016 and December 2018.</Td>

Would Provide Only a Very Limited Coercive Capability. We Judge it Unlikely that this Would be Sufficiently Useful in the Latter Half of the Decade to be a Cost-Effective Use of Defence Resources". This will Create a Capability Gap until a Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier Has Completed Integration with the First Operational Squadron of Joint Combat Aircraft.</Td>
