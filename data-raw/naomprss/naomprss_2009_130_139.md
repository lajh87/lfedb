• Post Main Investment Decision - Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (the Selected Equipment is Known as Meteor) will Provide Typhoon with the Capability to Combat Projected Air-to-Air Threats and Sustain Air Superiority Throughout the Life of the Aircraft. Until Meteor is Integrated, Typhoon will be Armed with the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, Acquired from Raytheon Missile Systems.

Key Features of the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile Requirement Include Stealthy Launch, Enhanced Kinematics (Giving Increased Stand-Off and Disengagement Ranges, a Better Ability to Pursue and Destroy Highly Agile Manoeuvring Targets), a Large No-Escape Zone and Robust Performance Against Countermeasures.

This is a Collaborative Programme With: Germany, Italy and Spain (for Typhoon), Sweden (for Gripen) and France (for Rafale).

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

On 2 October 1995, Minister (Defence Procurement) Gave Approval for the Issue of an Invitation to

Tender for Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile. the Invitation to Tender Was Issued on 5 December

1995\. Two Bids Were Received; One from a Consortium Led by Matra BAe Dynamics UK Ltd, and One from Raytheon Systems Ltd. After Extensive Analysis, it Was Decided that both Bids Contained Areas of Risk that Needed to be Addressed Before a Development and Production Contract Could be Placed. in May 1997, a Project Definition & Risk Reduction Phase Was Approved and Contracts Were Placed on both Bidders for a Period of One Year, with Results to be Technically and Operationally Assessed Before a Final Decision Was Made. Both Project Definition &
Risk Reduction Contracts Were Let in August 1997 and Revised Bids Were Received in May 1998.due to the Complexity of the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile Assessment, the Need to Accommodate the Requirements of the Prospective Partner Nations and the Need to Go for ‘best and Final’ Offers (Primarily as a Result of a French Request to Join the Programme), Main Gate Approval Was not Achieved until May 2000. in His Statement to the House of Commons on 16 May 2000, the Secretary of State Announced that the Matra BAe Dynamics Meteor Missile Had Been Selected.

## A.3. Progress

The Contract for the Demonstration, Manufacture and Support of Meteor Was Placed with MBDA UK Ltd on 23 December 2002. to Date Only the UK Has Committed to Production; the Contract Includes Production Options that can be Exercised by Partner Nations During the Demonstration Phase. the Unavailability of Typhoon Aircraft for Development and Integration Trials Has Necessitated a Realignment of the Development Programme, with Tornado F3 Introduced as the Primary Trials Platform, Supplemented by the Additional Use of a Gripen. There is an Aspiration to Re-Introduce Typhoon into the Programme as Missile Development Becomes more Mature. the Necessary Memorandum of Understanding and Contract Amendments Were Finalised in October 2008.

The Department Reviewed the Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile Programme in 2007/08 in the Light of the Changing Strategic Environment and Decided to Align the Integration of Meteor Onto Typhoon with the Delivery of a Major Aircraft Enhancements Package in Late 2014/Early 2015. a Proposal for Preliminary Typhoon Missile Carriage and Release Work is Targeted for Contract Award in Early 2009/10, as the Necessary First Step to Full Integration.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Meteor Capability is Required to Replace the Current AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air to Air

Missile Whose Capability Falls Significantly Below that of Meteor. the Procurement of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile Was a Temporary Solution to Provide Typhoon’s Anti-Air Capability for the Period Between Typhoon Operational Employment Date and Meteor ISD. Whilst the Continued Use of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile is not Expected to Affect Peacetime Air Policing, the Survivability and Capability of Typhoon in Almost all Operational Roles will be Compromised by Non-Delivery of Meteor. It will also Necessitate an Extension to the Life of Existing Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile Missiles Beyond the Currently Supported Date, and will Introduce a Risk that Stock Levels will be Insufficient to Meet the Operational Needs. Should Meteor Integration Slip, There will be a Need to Rapidly Procure and Integrate a Later Version of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile Onto Typhoon at Significant Cost.
