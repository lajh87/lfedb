# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The military requirement is for up to 8 Astute Class nuclear powered attack submarines to replace the existing Trafalgar Class.

Astute Class submarines are required to perform a range of military tasks; these unique requirements are combined within the Astute design to provide global reach, endurance, covertness, sustained high speed and the ability to conduct unsupported operations in hostile environments.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

In June 1991 (equivalent of Initial Gate) approval was given to proceed with a programme of studies at an estimated cost of £6 million (1991/1992 prices) to define the Batch 2 Trafalgar Class Submarine (now known as the Astute Class). This programme of studies led to the issue of an Invitation to Tender for the design and build of an initial batch of three Astute Class Submersible Ship Nuclear (SSN) and a further approval of £2 million (1992/1993 prices) for contractor and Defence Research Agency support to MOD during the tendering exercise in 1994.

In July 1994, as a result of concerns over the overall affordability of the programme, Minister (Defence Procurement) and the Treasury approved a further £24 million (at 1993/1994 prices) for risk reduction studies to be undertaken in parallel with the formal bid phase of the project. To maintain an effective competition, contracts for risk reduction were awarded to both bidders, GEC Marconi (now BAE Systems Maritime-Submarines) and Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd.

GEC-Marconi was identified as MOD’s preferred bidder in December 1995. Using the policy of No Acceptable Price No Contract, a Prime Contract was placed in March 1997 for the design, build and initial in service support of the first three of the Class.

## A.3. Project History

Please refer to previous MPRs for historical data on the Astute Class Programme.

Approvals

On 20 July 2011 Her Majesty’s Treasury approved revised time and costs for Boats 1 to 4 and approved

Main Build for Boat 5, Initial Build for Boat 6 and Long Lead Items for Boat 7. At this time the Investment

Approvals Committee also approved In-Service Dates for Boats 5, 6 and 7. On 8 June 2012 Her Majesty’s Treasury approved the whole Astute Programme (Boats 1 – 7) and corresponding Astute Support Solution.

Boat 1 HMS ASTUTE

In June 2011 HMS ASTUTE successfully completed the UK phase of Contractor Sea Trials. While on a comprehensive sea trials programme in US waters the submarine successfully completed the first of class

British Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles Firing Trials, final Spearfish deep discharge trials and underwater

Magnetic Silencing; returning to Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde in March 2012 to commence Base

Maintenance Period number 6. As a further element of the First of Class sea trials programme HMS ASTUTE has been fitted with a Payload Bay, which has, now been proven and demonstrated its additional capability. On 25 April 2013, HMS ASTUTE achieved Operational Handover (the scheduling authority transferred to the Royal Navy). This was followed by a short maintenance period to enable Force Generation prior to operational tasking. HMS ASTUTE is now deployed on operations.

Boat 2 AMBUSH

Boat 2 AMBUSH was launched and lowered in to the basin outside of the Devonshire Dock Hall on 6

January 2011. The submarine successfully completed her first test dive in the shipyard’s basin in early October 2011. Boat 2 HMS AMBUSH exited the shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness on 15 September 2012 and undertook the initial platform proving phase of Contractors Sea Trials through to December 2012. Following a maintenance period at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde, the submarine completed the second, Capability Proving Sea Trial phase at the end of July 2013. HMS AMBUSH reached Contract Acceptance Stage 1 Platform Demonstration, on 14 Dec 2012 from which point it has been managed as an In-Service Submarine under MOD rather than contractor direction. HMS Ambush was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy at HMNB Clyde on 1 Mar 2013. HMS AMBUSH achieved Operational Handover on 26 Jun 2013. Following a maintenance period at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde, the submarine continued with a second, Capability Proving Sea Trial phase which were completed at the end of July 2013. The vessel completed a Base Maintenance Period prior to operational tasking in 2014.

Boat 3 ARTFUL

A delay in supply of key Nuclear Steam Raising Plant components and a shortfall in volume of construction and outfit work against the plan prevented scheduled Core Load from being achieved against the baseline milestones. Core Load was completed in September 2013. ARTFUL was formally named on 20 Sep 13. A number of performance improvement activities have been put in place by the contractor to ensure that the programme remains on track to achieve Operational Handover in 2015.

Boat 4 AUDACIOUS

Construction and outfit of AUDACIOUS continues in the Devonshire Dock Hall, with the submarine having entered the ‘closed outfit’ phase in April 2013 (on completion of the final unit butt-weld). There has been a significant increase in test and commissioning activities during 2013/14 with Diesel Generator Trials being completed Jun 14.

Boat 5 ANSON

Boat 5 ANSON had her ‘keel laid’ on 13th October 2011, at a traditional keel laying ceremony where the Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth unveiled a section of her hull. The submarine has continued the open outfit stage in the Devonshire Dock Hall with some fabrication continuing in the New Assembly Shop. The largest Unit 6/7 (Accommodation and Command Unit) and the Forward End Construction were delivered to the Devonshire Dock Hall in September 2013 and December 2013 respectively. Fabrication of the Aft End Construction was completed in March 2014.

Boat 6 AGAMEMNON

Further tranches of material have been procured for Boat 6. Following receipt of Whole Programme approval in Jun 12 the programme has pursued a number of opportunities to batch buy materials for boats 5-7, delivering cost savings to the programme and protecting the later boats from the potential impact of material shortfalls. AGAMEMNON’s keel was laid in a formal ceremony on 18 July 2013 in the Devonshire Dock Hall which was attended by Minister (Defence Equipment & Support). Fabrication continues in the New Assembly Shop.

Boat 7

Procurement of long lead items for Boat 7 has commenced. As reported in MPR 13, the programme has pursued a number of opportunities to batch buy materials for Boats 5-7, delivering cost savings to the programme and protecting the later Boats from the potential impact of material shortfalls; this opportunity has allowed steel for Boat 7 to be cut early in January 2014.

ASTUTE CLASS TRAINING SERVICE

The Astute Class Training Service (ACTS) has provided training for the ships companies of both HMS

ASTUTE and AMBUSH and commenced training for the crew of ARTFUL. On 15 February 2012 the Investment Approvals Committee approved the Astute Class Training Service Boat 4 Information Note which articulated a revised funding approach for the ACTS Boat 4 change delivering a saving against the 2007 Astute Class Training Service Boat 4 approval. The training service provider, FAST, have submitted their bid for the addition of training for Boat 4 crews from May 2015.

SUPPORT

Submarine Production’s (SMP) revised approval sought to extend the principles and structure of the Initial Astute Support Solution model to Operational Handover (plus 3 months) for each of the 7 submarines. The additional 3 months post Operational Handover is to capture any residual transition costs that fall beyond the Operational Handover milestone for each submarine. The Astute support solution continues to mature as further experience is gained from sea. Both HMS ASTUTE and HMS AMBUSH have been successfully maintained through intensive trials periods and further action is underway to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to support the submarines as they progress towards operational deployments.

FOUNDATION CONTRACT

The MOD’s 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) plan to save at least £879M from the costs of the submarine programme to 2021 under the Submarine Enterprise Performance Programme (SEPP), resulted in a Foundation Contract with BAES M-S being signed on 17 July 2013 committing the company to a minimum target of £386M over an 8 year period.

## A.4. In-Year Progress Approvals

Following whole Astute Programme approval in 2012, an annual Information Note is submitted each year to provide an update on status of the Programme. The 2014 Information Note was submitted to IAC in December 2014 within which the cost to completion was estimated to exceed approval (50%) by £80m. The same financial pressure is not evident within this report due to variations between the scope of the extant approval and MPR in particular the recognition of the sunk costs on Boats 1-3. It is however worth noting that the programme is pursuing and number of business improvement opportunities that aims to improve schedule performance and generate further cost efficiency.

Boat 1 - HMS ASTUTE

As previously reported in MPR 14; on 25 April 2013, HMS ASTUTE achieved Operational Handover whereby the scheduling authority transferred from Defence Equipment & Support (DE&S) Submarine Production to the Royal Navy and is now a deployable submarine.

Boat 2 - HMS AMBUSH

As previously reported in MPR 14; on 26 June 2013 HMS AMBUSH achieved Operational Handover whereby the scheduling authority transferred from Defence Equipment & Support (DE&S) Submarine Production to the Royal Navy and is now a deployable submarine.

Boat 3 - ARTFUL

ARTFUL was launched in May 2014 in a significantly better material state than Astute Boats 1 & 2; this has resulted in a reduction in the length of the ‘in-water’ test & commissioning phase (from c.21 months to c.13 months). The submarine is currently berthed alongside Wet Dock Quay at BAE Systems’ Shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness having successfully completed its initial dive in early October 2014. The next key event is the start up & testing of the nuclear reactor, which is due to commence in early May 2015. The submarine is scheduled to Exit Barrow in early July 2015 before embarking on a focussed sea trials package prior to Operational Handover in Autumn 2015.

Boat 4 - AUDACIOUS

Construction and testing of AUDACIOUS continues in the Devonshire Dock Hall at Barrow-inFurness. Diesel Generator Trials were successfully completed in June 2014. There has been schedule slippage on the Reactor Line (critical path) during the reporting period primarily as a result of a programme clash between the reactor commissioning milestones of Primary Circuit Initial Fill in AUDACIOUS and Power Range Testing in ARTFUL. Key initiatives within BAES’ Business Improvement Programme (PULSAR) have been successfully rolled out in AUDACIOUS and agreement has been reached for the workforce to move to a more agile shift-working pattern. Forthcoming milestones include Primary Circuit Initial Fill (April 2015), Reactor Core Load (March 2016) and Launch (September 2016).

Boat 5 - ANSON

ANSON has continued its ‘open outfit’ phase with all major pressure hull Units having now been delivered to the Devonshire Dock Hall. Key milestones achieved during the period include completion of fabrication of the Aft End Construction, closure of the Unit 1 / Unit 2 butt weld and completion of the first phase of Primary Circuit Loop build. Areas of focus for the next 12 months include completion of the Unit 4 / Unit 5 butt weld (April 2015), which is a major milestone of activity on the Reactor Line (critical path). A number of other butt closures are scheduled as the build transitions from the ‘open outfit’ to ‘closed outfit’ phase; Unit 3 / Unit 4 (August 2015), Unit 7 / Unit 8 (January 2016) and Unit 2 / Unit 3 (April 2016).

Boat 6 - AGAMEMNON

Agamemnon’s Command Deck Module has been delivered from Cammell Lairds and is being outfitted. Units are now beginning to be shipped from the New Assembly Shop to the Devonshire Dock Hall in readiness for butt completion.

Boat 7 - Unnamed

Fabrication of main sub units is progressing within the New Assembly Shop with the production of the Top Half Gear Case and assembly of the Main Machinery Raft delivered to baseline.

ASTUTE CLASS TRAINING SERVICE

The Astute Class Training Service (ACTS) has continued to provide training for ships companies of HMS ASTUTE, HMS AMBUSH and ARTFUL. Preparation of media and facilities continues for the service delivery of training for Boat 4 crews from July 2015. On 18 December 2014, the IAC approved the ACTS Review Note for supplier engagement for extension of training service for Boat 5 and recommended that negotiation include options for contract extension to cover Boats 6 and 7. The supplier has been requested to propose a solution.

SUPPORT

The Astute support solution continues to mature as further experience is gained from sea time. Current focus is on preparations for ARTFUL exit and acceptance activities in the lead up to Contractor

Acceptance Stage 1 (CAS1) and Operational Handover (OH) later in 2015. In addition, work continues to the optimisation of Astute support to deliver increases reliability and availability.

FOUNDATION CONTRACT

The MOD’s 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) plan to save at least £879M from the costs of the submarine programme to 2021 under the Submarine Enterprise Performance Programme (SEPP), resulted in a Foundation Contract with BAES M-S being signed on 17 July 2013 committing the company to a share of the total £900M efficiency savings, through performance improvement, totalling at least £386M over an 8 year period of which a target of £195M will fall to the Astute programme. Across the period 17 July 2013 to 31 March 2015 the ASTUTE programme has secured efficiencies that yield financial savings of £92.8M.

## A.5. Capability Risks

Delivery of the ASTUTE Class is critical to the Royal Navy’s submarine’s readiness profile. Delays to the ASTUTE Class will result in the delayed introduction of improved capability over current classes. The Astute Class will also de-risk capability essential for an affordable Successor deterrent programme.

<td colspan="5">The Initial Astute Support Solution was approved in July 2006; it follows a traditional support model, but recognises Astute’s differences and introduces additional arrangements as appropriate. Provision has been made to employ the build contractor (BAE Systems) as the Astute Technical Authority; MOD will be the Approving Authority, with the Nuclear Propulsion Project Team responsible for the Nuclear Steam Raising Plant. MOD Equipment Project Teams will support specific equipments with Head of In-Service Submarine (Head of Submarine Production up to Operational Handover) maintaining a Platform focus and providing the flotilla wide single point of contact for Navy Command. Astute Class Maintenance at the waterfront will be conducted under existing Maritime Services Delivery Framework arrangements. The revised approach was included as part of the whole programme approval in June 2011. The Astute Class Training Service is a Private Finance Initiative contract, initially approved for 36 years to provide Astute Class specific training to the Royal Navy for Boats 1-3. Approval was given in 2007, to extend to a 38-year contract, to cover the life of Boat 4. 18 December 2014, the IAC approved the ACTS Review Note for supplier engagement for extension of training service for Boat 5 and recommended that negotiation include options for contract extension to cover Boats 6 and 7. Approval for later Boats will be considered during FY15/16 as part of the option set for the delivery of a coherent training solution led by Submarine Training Capability Programme. MPR13 reports against the Astute Support Solution approved by HM Treasury in May 2012. The principles and funding to the Initial Support Solution is provided by the Submarine Production team and transfers to In-service project teams at an appropriate point.</td>
