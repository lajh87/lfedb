# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

Indirect Fire Precision Attack will provide, by incremental acquisition, a suite of munitions for indirect precision attack of static, mobile, and manoeuvring targets, extending to ranges in excess of 150 kilometres.

The capability required under Indirect Fire Precision Attack will be delivered through a structured programme of Assessment, Demonstration and Manufacture phases. To support the incremental nature of the programme an overarching Assessment Phase is providing the evidence to support decisions on individual components via a series of Main Gate Business Cases.

The Assessment Phase is indicating that the Indirect Fire Precision Attack capability is likely to be achieved by a mixture of guided rockets, enhanced artillery shells and Loitering Munitions. They will carry a variety of payloads. Indirect Fire Precision Attack munitions will make use of a number of in-service platforms such as the Multiple Launch Rocket System and the AS90 self-propelled howitzer. It is assumed that Loitering Munitions may require their own platform or could use the Multiple Launch Rocket System launcher. The mix of munitions procured under the programme will have a range of In-Service Dates: this multi-solution approach is being managed through an incremental procurement strategy.

A Main Gate Business Case for the first component, a 155mm Ballistic Sensor Fuzed Munition, was approved in July 2007, with a target In Service Date of September 2011. The second component will be the Loitering Munition. Loitering Munitions are unmanned and designed to fly to a re-programmable location and remain in a holding pattern until given a target. They will be controlled by a man-in-the-loop who will have a real-time image of the intended target.

## A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Initial Gate Business Case for Indirect Fire Precision Attack was approved in May 2001. Following competition using a Capability Based Questionnaire, an Assessment Phase contract was awarded in May 2002 to a consortium of companies led by BAE Systems Strategic Capability Solutions (now BAE Systems Future Systems). This first Assessment Phase was designed to provide, and iteratively update, a ‘Route Map’ to achieving the full Indirect Fire Precision Attack capability with recommendations about the type, quantities and mix of munitions.

In line with the approved Indirect Fire Precision Attack strategy for an incremental programme, a series of Assessment Phases will be conducted, each being approved by a separate Review Note. A contract for the second Assessment Phase was placed with the BAE Systems led consortium in January 2007. This included the Loitering Munition Capability Demonstration programme, which completed in December 2008.

In light of the incremental procurement strategy, procurement of components will be approved via a series of Main Gate Business Cases. After each component receives Main Gate approval, it will be managed as a separate programme in its own right. However, each capability will continue to be included in the ongoing operational analysis work, so that the overall mix and quantity of munitions to be procured can be refined as the programme progresses. In the case of Loitering Munitions, further Assessment Phase work is required in the short term which will be delivered as part of the Complex Weapons Assessment Phase. This was approved by the Investment Approvals Board in June 2008.

A contract for the Demonstration and Manufacture of the first component, Ballistic Sensor Fuzed Munition, was placed with Gesellschaft für Intelligente Wirksysteme mbH in September 2007.

## A.3 Progress

An information note was submitted on the Ballistic Sensor Fuzed Munition Programme in April 2009 due to a change in the requirement. A review note is planned for submission in summer 2009. A Main Gate submission for Loitering Munitions in planned for \\\

## A.4 Capability Risks

The impact of not having Indirect Fire Precision Attack is that the Land Component would have no organic capability to attack with precision, targets beyond the range of direct fire weapons such as tanks and anti-tank guided weapons. In this respect Attack Helicopters are considered as direct fire weapons as the helicopter crew have to be able to see the target. This means that the indirect fire systems can only suppress or neutralise enemy forces beyond the range of direct fire weapons by using un-guided munitions. This results in large wastage and a very significant collateral damage problem which is unacceptable. The two benefits of having Indirect Fire Precision Attack, therefore, are the ability to destroy targets that UK Forces could previously only suppress and that UK Forces can do so without causing significant collateral damage. That Indirect Fire Precision Attack is organic to the Land Component is important because of the persistence and responsiveness of organic capabilities. Whilst aircraft can deliver precision weapons against targets beyond the range of direct fire weapons they lack persistence and are generally not responsive; they have to be pre-planned or booked and can only stay on station for a short period.
