# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile (BVRAAM) (also Known as Meteor) will Provide Typhoon with the Capability to Combat Projected Air-to-Air Threats and Sustain Air Superiority Throughout the Life of the Aircraft. the Weapon is Required to Operate in all Weather Conditions and will Complement Typhoon’s Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM). Until Meteor Enters Service, Typhoon will be Armed with the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Contracted to Raytheon Missile Systems.

The Key Features of the Requirement Include Stealthy Launch, Enhanced Kinematics (Giving Increased Stand-Off and Disengagement Ranges, a Better Ability to Chase and Destroy Highly Agile Manoeuvring Targets) and Robust Performance Against Countermeasures.

This is a Collaborative Programme with 5 Other Partner Nations;
Germany, Spain and Italy (for Typhoon), Sweden (for JAS 39 Gripen) and France (for Rafale). the Contract for the Demonstration, Manufacture and Support of Meteor Was Placed with MBDA UK Ltd on 23 December 2002. Only the United Kingdom Has Committed to Production; the Contract Includes Production Options that can be Exercised by Partner Nations During the Demonstration Programme. the Typhoon Integration Programme Has Encountered Delays that Have Prompted Various Meteor Realignment Options to be Examined. the First Air-Launched Firing of Meteor is Scheduled for May 2006. This will Support the Demonstration of Key Technical Milestones 1 (Demonstration of Ramjet Propulsion System) and 2 (Demonstration of Guidance and Control of the Airframe).

## 3e. Operational Impact of ISD Variation

Extend Reliance on the Current AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM). AMRAAM Capability Falls Significantly Below that of Meteor and Was Planned as a Temporary Solution, Providing Typhoon Anti-Air Capability for the Period Between Typhoon Operational Employment Date and Meteor ISD. Whilst the ISD Delay is not Expected to Affect Peacetime Policing of Sovereign Airspace, the Survivability and Capability of Typhoon in Almost all Operational Roles will be Compromised. It Should be Noted that a Staged Transfer from AMRAAM to Meteor is Necessary Due to the Latter’s Delivery Profile, and Hence Use of AMRAAM by Typhoon Extends Beyond Meteor ISD. There is Significant Risk that Part of the AMRAAM Stocks will be Unable to Meet the Revised ISD and Hence We may Fall Below the Minimum Acceptable Stockpile Liability, Although this Cannot be Confirmed at Present.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

On 2 October 1995, Minister (Defence Procurement) Gave Approval for the Issue of an Invitation to Tender (ITT) for BVRAAM. the ITT Was Issued on 5 December 1995. Two Bids Were Received; One from a Consortium Led by Matra BAE Dynamics (MBD) UK Ltd, and One from Raytheon Systems Ltd. After Extensive Analysis, it Was Decided that both Bids Contained Areas of Risk that Needed to be Addressed Before a Development and Production Contract Could be Placed. in May 1997 a Project Definition & Risk Reduction (PDRR) Phase Was Approved and Contracts Were Placed on both Bidders for a Period of One Year with Results to be Technically and Operationally Assessed Before a Final Decision Was Made. Both PDRR Contracts Were Let in August 1997 and Revised Bids Were Received in May 1998.

Due to the Complexity of the BVRAAM Assessment, the Need to Accommodate the Requirements of the Prospective Partner Nations and the Need to Go for Best and Final Offers (BAFOs) Primarily as a Result of the French Request to Join the Programme, Main Gate Approval Was not Achieved until May

2000\. in His Statement to the House of Commons on 16 May 2000, Secretary of State Announced that MBD’s Meteor Missile Had Been Selected.
