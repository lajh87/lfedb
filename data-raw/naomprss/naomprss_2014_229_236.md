# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent Cm 6994, to Maintain a Continuous at Sea Nuclear Deterrent by Means of a New Class of Submarine. This will Replace the Current Vanguard Class as it Comes Out of Service.

The Submarines are Part of the MOD's Committed Core Equipment Programme as Announced by the Secretary of State on 14 May 2012. Any Decision to Build will not be Taken until after the Next General Election Expected in 2015 with any Main Gate Approval Expected in 2016.

The Successor Boats are Expected to Have a 25 Year Life with the Option of at Least a Five Year Extension and Suitable Low Detectability. the Current Planned Service Entry Date for the First Boat is 2028.

A Common Missile Compartment for the Submarine is Being Developed with the United States. This will House the Trident Strategic Weapon System.

Next Generation Nuclear Propulsion Plant: At Initial Gate in April 2011, the Decision Was Taken to Power the Submarine with a Nuclear Propulsion System Known as Pressurised Water Reactor 3 (PWR3) which Incorporates the Latest Safety Technologies and Ensures the Boats Have the Performance to Deliver the United Kingdom's Minimum Credible Nuclear Deterrent Out to the 2060s.

The Nuclear Propulsion Critical Technology Programme Brings Focused Investment to Regenerate the UK Nuclear Propulsion Design and Support Capability, and Ensures We Have the Design Base Essential to Maintain a Strategic Sovereign UK Nuclear Capability.

The Wider Programme: The Strategic Defence and Security Review Concluded that it Would be Possible to Defer Decisions on the Replacement of both the Warhead and Infrastructure Elements of the Programme. Over the Next few Years Concept Studies will Begin to Refine Potential Programmes and Costs. No Decision as to Whether a New Warhead Design is Needed will be Taken until the Next Parliament. Neither the Warhead nor Infrastructure is Covered in this Report.

The Rolls-Royce Core Production Capability Facility at Raynesway Has Passed Main Gate and will Provide the Fuel Cores for Successor. This is Covered by a Separate Project Summary Sheet.

The Expected Overall Cost of any Replacement of the Nuclear Deterrent Remains as Set Out in Para 5-11 of the 2006 White Paper as Between
£15-20bn for a Four Boat Solution.

## A.2. Assessment Phase History

The MOD's Future Submarines Project Team Was Established in 2007 from a Small Group Within the then Nuclear Directorate.

Three Companies, BAE Submarine Solutions (Platform), Babcock (Support), and Rolls-Royce (Power Plant) Known as the Tier One Industrial Partners Were Awarded Contracts for the Collaborative Concept Phase. This Work Informed the Options Considered at Initial Gate. a Technical Demonstrator Programme Was also Undertaken.

An Integrated Project Management Team Has also Been Established.

Initial Gate Was Approved on 14th April 2011 and Announced in Parliament on 18 May 2011 when a Report to Parliament, "The United Kingdom's Future Nuclear Deterrent: The Submarine Initial Gate Parliamentary Report" Was Made.

This Followed a Concept Phase from 2006/07 to April 2011 During which
£905m Was Approved.

This Period Saw the Preparation and Staffing of the Initial Gate Business Case Through the MOD and Treasury with Treasury Approval Received on 29th March 2011.

2010 also Saw the SDSR Strategic Defence and Security Review, "Securing Britain in an Age of

Uncertainty: Publication of the Strategic Defence and Security Review"
Chapter Three, Published on

19 October 2010, and the Trident Value for Money Review (Fact Sheet Ten). These Made Changes to the

White Paper Assumptions. These Included: a Deferral of the Planned Delivery of the First Submarine from 2024 to 2028, and a Deferral of the Main Gate Decision Point from 2014 to 2016. There Was also Agreement with the United States on the Major Parameters of the Jointly-Developed Common Missile Compartment Design that will be Capable of Carrying the Current Trident D5 Missiles and any Replacement Missile Once the D5 Reaches the End of Its Expected Life in the 2040s.

Initial Gate Considered the Submarine Design using Pull Through of Astute Technology to Reduce Cost and Design and Delivery Risk, and Provide Commonality in Training and Maintenance. There Were also Opportunities to Take Advantage of Developments Since the Astute Design.

One Such Was the Selection of Pressure Water Reactor 3 as the Submarine's Propulsion System. Pressure Water Reactor 3 Provides Superior Performance and Meets the Nuclear Safety Regulator's Requirement to Continually Improve Our Performance and Meet the "As Low as Reasonably Practicable" Requirement. However Pressure Water Reactor 3 is more Expensive to Buy and Operate over a 25 Year Period, but Cheaper if the Boats are Run for Longer.

The Coalition's Policy on the Successor Deterrent is Clear, and it is that it is Committed to the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent Based on a Ballistic Missile Submarine. the Trident Alternatives Study will Form Part of the Information Considered to Assist the Decisions Needed at Main Gate.

Immediately Following Approval, Design Activities Commenced under an Extension of the Concept Contract While the Full Design Phase and Engineering Services Framework Contracts Were Finalised and Signed with BAE Submarine Solutions and Babcock on 13 December 2011. These Cover the Period Up to Main Gate and Consist of an Overarching Framework Structure with Rolling Waves of Task Packages. a Contract Amendment to Align with These Contracts Was also Placed with Rolls-Royce. a Collaborative Agreement Between all Three Companies and the MOD Was also Signed. This Governs the Relationships Between Industrial Parties’ Performance and Profit Retention.

The MOD and Integrated Programme Management Teams Have Been Established and Teams Built Up in Barrow and Derby. an Integrated Master Schedule Has Been Agreed with Industry Across the Programme.

Annual Notes on Progress are Submitted to the MOD's Investment Approvals Committee and HMT in July.

The Ship Specification, which Decomposes the User Requirement into Specific Requirements for Each Submarine System and Attribute, Has Been Fully Developed and Placed under Configuration Control with the Exception of Outfitting Requirements. the First Phase of the Platform Detailed Design Programme, Design Intent Definition which Confirms the System Architectures, Completed to Plan in December 2012 with a Major Design Review (System Definition Review, SDR) Across all of the Major Systems Areas. During December 2012, the Annual Report to Parliament Was Submitted and in March 2013, the MoD Investment Approvals Committee Approved the Build Strategy for the Common Missile Compartment.

## A.3. in-Year Progress

The Detailed Design of the Pressurised Water Reactor 3 (PWR3) Plant is Now Well Advanced with all Significant Design Decisions Have Been Taken.

Similarly, Design of the Platform Continues to Progress Well. a Successful Interim Whole Boat Preliminary Design Review Was Held in December 2013 with the Full PDR Scheduled for November 2014.

The IAC and HMT Approved Bringing Forward Post-Main Gate Platform Funding Amounting to £261m - £55m for Additional Long Lead Material Purchases and £201m to Commit to Facilities Upgrades at the BAES Barrow Boat Yard. the Bring-Forward is not Additional Funding; the Total Cost of the Programme Remains the Same, it is Purely a Bring-Forward of Programmed Funding Post MG into the IG Period, Therefore No Programme Cost Growth Overall. This is Early Expenditure to De-Risk the Programme. Separately, £3m of Platform Approval Was Provided to NGNPP to Pay for Additional Contractor Assistance in the US.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Without the Design and Build of a New Class of Ballistic Missile Submarines, the United Kingdom Would be Unable to Maintain Its Independent Nuclear Deterrent Once the Current Vanguard Class Goes Out of Service. This Decision Was Agreed by Parliament in 2007 Following the 2006 White Paper: "The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent"
Cm 6994. the Current Government also Supports the Maintenance of the United Kingdom’s Independent Nuclear Deterrent Capability.

The Nuclear Deterrent is a Current Operation.

The Assessment Phase Approved Costs Reflect a £47m Approvals Between Next Generation Nuclear

Power Plant and Future Submarines. Though Forecast as £60m Within the Common Missile Compartment Review Note (Dated January 2013) Subsequent Review Has Reduced this to £47m. This Was Formalised in the Annual Review Note to the Investment Approvals Committee 2013.

A Bring-Forward of Funding Was Approved by HM Treasury During the Year for the Investment in

Barrow Facilities and Long Lead Items Amounting to £261m Hence Our Approval Position Has Increased by this Value.

Costs Shown in the Initial Gate Approval Do not Include Recoverable VAT, the Assumption Being that

Ship Builder Relief Would Apply as it Did on Astute. Such Relief will be Provided Retrospectively over the Assessment Phase from the Point of Starting the Build. the Future Submarines Project Team Has, However, to Account for VAT and Books all Commitments and Sunk Costs Against the Approval Inclusive of VAT. to Ensure that Commitments and Approval are Compared on a VAT-Comparable Basis, Recoverable VAT Has Been Deducted from the Figures Presented in MPR 14.

Since the Approval Granting Development of a New Nuclear Steam Raising Plant (NSRP -Designated Pressurised Water Reactor 3) at Initial Gate Was Received, the Detailed NSRP Design Has Progressed Through a Number of Formal Gates, Each of Increasing Maturity. the Design is Now Progressing Well Towards the Critical Design Review (CDR); this Review is Scheduled for December 2014 and this is when the Design will be Frozen Enabling the Department to Progress Its Formal Technical and Safety Review and Approval of this New Reactor Design. Critical Design Review Signifies the Completion of the Detailed Plant Design, and Therefore Provides High Confidence that the NSRP will Achieve 100 per Cent Design Maturity by Main Gate.

The Pressurised Water Reactor 3 (PWR3) Design Represents a Step Change in Technology from

Pressurised Water Reactor 2 (PWR2), Leveraging Off a High Level of Technology Transfer from the US. the Principle Themes in this Step Change Involve Increasing the Engineering Robustness of the Basic Design which Enables a Simpler Plant with Fewer Components, Reduced Reliance on Shore Infrastructure and Far more Benign Operating Characteristics. These Changes Have, However, Involved Considerable Challenges for the UK in Terms of the Numbers of Nuclear Suitably Qualified Experienced Personnel Required to Enact Them. for Example, the Level of Effort Required to Develop and Therefore De-Risk 40 New Manufacturing Techniques Specific to the PWR3 Plant Has Only Become Clear During the Detailed Design Phase Since Initial Gate. in Numerical Terms, this under-Estimation Has Resulted in an Average Additional 136 Full Time Equivalents per Year in the Assessment Phase Therefore the Overall Non-Recurring Expenditure Programme Costs Exceed the Original Initial Gate Expectations. This Has Occurred Because, in Essence, the Next Generation Nuclear Propulsion Plant Project Has Set About a Concurrent Programme Regenerating UK Design “know How” in Parallel with the Early Development of the PWR3 Concept. in Simple Terms the Level of Modern Safety Standards Analysis, Expectations and Demonstration in the UK Regulatory Framework for the Development of a New Pressurised Water Reactor Has Been Greater than that Estimated Prior to Initial Gate Even Taking the Benefits of the Read-Across from US Plant Designs. Many Technical Issues Have Had to be Solved, but in Relative Terms it Was the Sheer Volume of Work to Underpin a New Nuclear Power Plant Design that Was under-Estimated. on Reflection, this Could Have Been Anticipated as the UK Has Never Before Executed Such a Significant Plant Design; Even PWR2 in the 1980s Was a Modest Evolution of the PWR1 Design.

Concept Phase (Pre-Assessment Phase): Costs Have Been Included Due to the Scale. Usually, Concept Phase Costs are Relatively Small, but Given the Size of this Project They Have Been Included for Full Disclosure. Concept Phase Costs to 31 March 2013: There is a £1m Variation from MPR 13 to MPR 14, Formerly £803m Now Reported as £802m, this is Due to a Correction Made Following the Statutory Audit of the 2012-13 Departmental Resource Accounts to Reduce Accruals by £61k Causing a Rounding Difference.
