<th>Scout SV will provide the mounted reconnaissance capability integral to Army 2020 by equipping the Army with a fully digitised tracked armoured vehicle, designed as a manned, all-weather persistent, intelligence gathering capability with built in growth. Integral to Army 2020 plans, it delivers a Base ISTAR-like capability from a globally deployable ground platform to meet the demands of contingent operations. The emerging Army 2020 planning assumption is to deliver a reconnaissance fleet of at least  vehicles, but numbers and fleet will not be set until Main Gate 2</th>

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

GENERAL: Future Rapid Effect System Specialist Vehicles entered its assessment phase (Assessment Phase 2) in June 2008. The approval covered the anticipated Specialist Vehicles fleet scope, with high priority afforded to Scout (Recce Block 1), given the pressing need to replace Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked). Specialist Vehicles was assumed to consist of three Recce Blocks plus Medium Armour and Manoeuvre Support components, all mounted on a common base platform. In broad terms the Assessment Phase Studies confirmed that the Common Base Platform concept was viable for all platforms and also set the time, cost performance and risk envelope for Recce Block 1.

TRADE-OFFS: Assessment Studies were used to derive the preferred Programme Option and its associated characteristics of performance (requirements), cost, time and risk, ahead of launching a competition to select the Prime contractor. These studies included an analysis of potential solutions ranging from off-the-shelf platforms, modified off-the-shelf, and new design, as well as studies on critical sub-system choices e.g. primary sighting system. Industry was engaged throughout to ensure data used reflected market reality, whilst still keeping competitive choices open. The Military Customer and User were engaged throughout the process.

ACQUISITION STRATEGY: Assessment Phase 2 also determined the most appropriate Acquisition

Strategy for the Specialist Vehicles. The product of this strand was subject to a separate Investment

Approvals Board Approval. This Approval endorsed the use of open international competition to select a 'prime contractor' to conduct the demonstration phase for Recce Block 1, and subject to further approval included progression to manufacture and initial in-service support, together with a Common Base Platform for all Specialist Vehicles. Major enabling sub-systems e.g. Guided Weapons (missiles) for later Recce Blocks were not included in the scope of Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform in order to leave competitive choice for later Recce Blocks e.g. missile coherence with Team Complex Weapons. An update to the Acquisition Strategy was endorsed in January 2013. In line with the Common Base Platform concept the Protected Mobility Recce Support vehicle can be used with minor sub-system changes for the Ambulance, Command and Engineer Recce roles. Similarly, for the three remaining roles, further studies have been contracted to assess these requirements.

The Recce Block 1 element of Assessment Phase 2 was conducted in four Stages, with the key findings from each stage captured in a stage report. The final stage - the formal competition and Investment Approvals Board approval for Demonstration was conducted under an aggressive timeline with transition through Main Gate 1 achieved seven months ahead of forecast. In 2010, the project was subject to reapproval by the new coalition government which delayed contract award by three months, due to the preelection period.

Assessment Phase 2 included risk reduction studies and demonstrators on the Specialist Vehicles platforms and on high performance thermal imaging sighting systems which were subsequently downselected as part of the main competition.

The Recce Block 1 element of the Assessment Phase 2 concluded with a major international competition, which selected General Dynamics UK Ltd as the Prime Contractor.

## A.3. Project History

MAIN GATE 1 - DEMONSTRATION RECCE BLOCK 1 ONLY: The outcome of the Specialist Vehicles

Assessment Phase for Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform was presented as evidence for the Specialist Vehicles Main Gate 1 approval for entry into Demonstration. As part of this Main Gate 1 approval, the Office of Government Commerce conducted a Gateway Review in September 2009, followed by a full Major Projects Review Group examination in December 2009, which confirmed that

Specialist Vehicles was in a position to proceed to its planned Demonstration phase with General

Dynamics UK Ltd as the Prime contractor. Approval was re-endorsed by the new Coalition Government in

June 2010. The contract with General Dynamics UK Ltd commits to the Demonstration Phase for Recce

Block 1 only, whilst taking contractual option for manufacture for Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform options for later Blocks and initial in-service support. This contract includes seven Anchor Milestones.

Main Gate 1 did not set Initial Operating Capability, Full Operating Capability or total fleet requirements, but merely noted the planning assumptions associated with these for service entry at the time. There was also recognition that the then forthcoming Strategic Defence and Security Review could change total fleet requirements and assumptions, and these should not therefore be set at Main Gate 1.

Planning Round 11 and Strategic Defence and Security Review Savings Options removed the Medium Armour element and reset the total vehicle fleet numbers up to \\\, with the delivery profile recast to aspire to the emerging Army restructuring under Strategic Defence and Security Review (Five Multi Role Brigades). Final size and shape of the Specialist Vehicles fleet will not be set until Main Gate 2, in \\\
when the first major production investment decision will be taken. The Recce Block 1 Planning

Assumption for Service Entry was also deferred by nine months from
\\\ to \\\ due to a Strategic Defence and Security Review savings option. The enduring need for the Specialist Vehicles project was noted in an Information Note to the Investment Approvals Committee in June 2011.

FURTHER APPROVALS: It should be noted that Specialist Vehicles does not have a single Main Gate Approval. The size of the programme, together with previous lessons learned in other programmes, determined that a two stage Main Gate approach should be used; Main Gate 1 for entry into

Demonstration for Recce Block 1 and Common Base Platform only, with a second Main Gate (2) for entry into production, the latter being the major investment decision. Later approvals (in effect sub-Main Gates) will approve Demonstration and Manufacture of the remaining Protected Mobility Recce Support roles and any future needs.

DEMONSTRATION PHASE PROGRESS: Continuing to build on progress made in 2011/12, the programme completed its initial milestones reaching the entry review into the Preliminary Design Review.

MAIN WEAPONS SELECTION - SCOUT: Approval for the selection of the 40mm Case Telescope

Weapon System was given in 2008 to enable commonality with the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme, thus taking the benefit of common ammunition and training. Qualification for the 40mm Case Telescoped Weapon System is led by the Scout - Specialist Vehicles team.

In 2012-13, the programme continued to make progress with a number of design maturity events including Mine Blast De-risking, Mobile Test Rig trials and an Ambulance role mock-up, culminating in the achievement of Preliminary Design Review exit in December 2012 and the first Anchor Milestone.

In parallel, assessment studies, including representative mock-ups, confirmed that Ambulance, Command and Engineer Recce roles could be delivered by sub-system installation on the Protected Mobility Recce

Support vehicle. Assessment studies continued on options for the remaining roles of Formation Recce

(Overwatch), Joint Fires Command and Ground Base Surveillance roles, against the existing User

Requirements, to determine whether incremental upgrades are required to develop their capability further

Planning Round 12 made a number of assumptions on fleet numbers \\\
the follow on Recce Block 2 and 3 assessment, and the Planning Assumption for Service Entry \\\, pending Army 2020, Rebasing and Main Gate 2.

An Information Note was circulated in January 2013 to provide a general update with an expectation that a further approval update would be submitted later in 2013.

## A.5. Capability Risks

Scout Specialist Vehicles will replace Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) which has already been extended beyond its planned out of service date through a series of modifications and Urgent Operational Requirements. Combat Vehicles Reconnaissance (Tracked) is restricted by its very small design meaning that it has reached its operational capacity against the Army’s needs. Combat Vehicles Reconnaissance (Tracked) must be replaced (by Scout Specialist Vehicles) to avoid a long term capability gap opening up in essential manned ground reconnaissance.
