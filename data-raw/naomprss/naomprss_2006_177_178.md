Integrated Project Team Responsible:

TACTICAL UNMANNED AIR VEHICLE (TUAV)

Single Point of Accountability for project capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition & Reconnaissance)

Senior Responsible Owner for broader capability:

Assistant Chief of the Air Staff

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT

The Watchkeeper system will consist of unmanned air vehicles, sensors, and ground control stations. It will provide the Land Component Commander with a 24 hour, all weather, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) capability supplying accurate, timely and high quality imagery to answer Commanders’ critical information requirements.

The Strategic Defence Review New Chapter identified that the ability to gather information about an opponent and to then use it to maximum effect is central to future combat capabilities in both high intensity conflicts and peace support operations. The Defence Strategic Guidance, The Future Capabilities Requirement 2002 and more recently the Future Land Operational Concept 2004 highlighted the importance of an ISTAR system of networked sensors. Capability audits have further identified the importance of a LAND ISTAR system being fully integrated with other land surveillance systems and able to operate within the context of Joint Operations.

# SECTION 2: THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

Note: Actual in service dates and costs are not set until projects reach the point in time when the main investment decision is made ie Main Gate approval. Until this point all costs and dates are outline assumptions solely for internal planning purposes.

## 2a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Watchkeeper is a consolidation of the Sender and Spectator projects. Initial Gate approval was received for Sender in November 1999 and approval for a joint Assessment Phase for both projects

171

was given in July 2000.

The acquisition strategy has been based on selecting Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) systems to suit a defined capability requirement rather than an air vehicle-centred approach. Through evaluation and system concept demonstration, the Assessment Phase has driven down technical and schedule risks and derived the whole life costs associated with the proposed options. User and System Requirements were identified and revalidated. Trade-off activity was undertaken, taking full account of the impact across all Lines of Development and supported by balance of investment studies.

Alternative acquisition options have been considered. Public Private Partnership/Private Finance Initiative was not deemed appropriate for the provision of a tactical capability deployed in theatre, due to the potential risks to contractor personnel and the required levels of availability as well as legal implications. Collaboration was explored during the early stages of the Assessment Phase, but it was not possible to align requirements. There is continuing dialogue with and between allied nations on matters of requirement definition, technology, operational experience and acquisition. The need for significant system integration with the emerging Network Enabled Capability requirements led the Defence Procurement Agency and the potential contractors to adopt an incremental approach. This approach also supports the Force Readiness Cycle and provides for a phased uplift of capability at discrete intervals.

Opportunities to enhance Watchkeeper beyond the Full Operating Capability have been considered during the Assessment Phase and will inform future investment decisions.

Following a competitive process, Thales (UK) was announced as preferred bidder in July 2004. The programme completed the Assessment Phase of the acquisition cycle in July 2005, when Main Gate approval was given to proceed to the Demonstration and Manufacture phase with Thales (UK) as the prime contractor.
