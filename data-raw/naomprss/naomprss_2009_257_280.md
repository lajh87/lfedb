# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

United Kingdom Military Flying Training System will Deliver a Coherent, Flexible and Integrated Flying Training Capability Catering for the Needs of the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the Army Air Corps. the Flying Training System Takes Aircrew from Initial Training Through Elementary, Basic and Advanced Flying Training Phases to their Arrival at their Designated Operational Aircraft. the Current System is at Risk of Being Unable to Deliver the Required Quantity and Quality of Aircrew to Meet the Input Standard for the Operational Conversion Units. the Existing Training Platforms are Approaching the End of their Useful Lives and Include Outdated Systems that are Unable to Prepare Trainees for Current and Future Front Line Aircraft. the Current System is Based on a Number of Separate Contractual Arrangements for the Provision of Equipment and Support. Consequently the System is Piecemeal, Difficult to Manage and Inefficient. It also Introduces Significant Delays Due to Lengthy Training Programmes and Gaps Between Courses.

The Focus for United Kingdom Military Flying Training System is to Achieve a Holistic System Based on Capability and Service Delivery; it is not Solely About the Provision of Aircraft Platforms. It also Offers an Opportunity to Modernise the Flying Training Processes for all Three Services, Realise Efficiencies And, Since Training is Currently Spread Across Several Organisations, Take Advantage of Potential Economies of Scale.

Advanced Jet Trainer

The MOD Requires an Advanced Jet Trainer for Pre-Operational Training of Fast-Jet Pilots. This Task is Currently Fulfilled by the Hawk T Mk1 Aircraft, which will Need to be Replaced in the Tactical Weapons Training Role from 2010 Onwards. the Full Range of Skills Required for Aircrew to Fly Front-Line Aircraft Cannot Now be Gained using the Current Advanced Jet Trainer, so more Training on Operational Aircraft Has to be Undertaken. the Introduction of Typhoon and the Future Joint Combat Aircraft Exacerbates this Training Gap Such that the Required Standard for Typhoon Aircrew is not Achievable with Hawk T Mk1.

The Advanced Jet Trainer is the Fast Jet Element of the Wider UK Military Flying Training System Programme and will Deliver Capabilities Including: a Modern Glass Cockpit Environment, an Avionics Suite Compliant with Latest Airspace Legislation, an Embedded Training System that Simulates Front-Line Sensors and Weapons, and a Flexible and Upgradeable Mission System. Support, Infrastructure and a Ground Based Training Environment will also be Provided. Advanced Jet Trainer is Contracted for in Such a Way to Ensure that it can be Subsumed Within the Main UK Military Flying Training System Contract at a Later Date.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Four Possible Procurement Options Were Identified at Initial Gate. the Do-Nothing Option Was Discounted. the Do Minimum Option Would not Deliver the Required Quality and Quantity of Students in the Correct Timescales. the Remaining Options, Public Private Partnership/Private Finance Initiative and Smart Conventional, Were Tested in a Convergence Phase which Concluded that the Adoption of a Public Private Partnership Contractual Partnering Model Would Best Harness the Collective Skills of MOD and Industry by Utilising a Mix of Private Finance Initiative and Conventional Procurement to Deliver a Coherent and Flexible System of Systems.

This Option Envisaged the Appointment of a Training System Partner to Work with the MOD over the Life of the Project to Deliver Incrementally the Total Aircrew Training Requirement. the Strategy Was Approved by Investment Approvals Board in February 2005. an Invitation to Negotiate Was Issued to Three Consortia in March 2005; the Bids Were Received in August 2005. the Main Gate Business Case (Stage 1) Was Approved by Investment Approvals Board and Ascent Was Announced as Preferred Bidder in November 2006. the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Main Gate (Stage 2) Submission in the Form of an Information Note Was Submitted in December 2007. This Was Approved by Minister (Defence Equipment and Support) and Treasury in February 2008.

Additional Assessment Work will be Required Post-Main Gate for the Different Training Platforms that will be Acquired Incrementally. These Increments will be Subject to Further Approvals.

Advanced Jet Trainer

At Initial Gate (December 2002) Advanced Jet Trainer Was a Component of United Kingdom Military Flying Training System. Within the £39m Approved for United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Assessment, £2m Related to Advanced Jet Trainer and a PFI Approach Was Assumed. in July 2003 a Ministerial Direction Was Given to Conventionally Procure Hawk 128 from BAE Systems.

In 2003 a £31m Risk Reduction Contract Was Placed with BAE Systems to Cover Risk Reduction Activities to October 2003. BAE Systems Continued to Work at Risk on Assessment Phase Activities Up to November 2004 when Approval Was Given for a Combined Assessment & Development Phase Based on an Incremental Approach at a not to Exceed Price of £196m and a not to Exceed Completion Date of August 2008; the Assessment Phase Element of this Approval Was Around £75m. a Design and Development Contract Was Let to BAE Systems in December 2004.

Main Gate Approval Was Achieved in August 2006 for a not to Exceed Figure of £497m at 80% Confidence, Compared to Initial Gate Approval of £611m at 90%. This Approval Set the Aircraft Build Standard, Definition of in-Service Date, Key System Requirements and Aircraft Numbers.

In May 2008 a Contract Was Placed with BAE Systems to Extend the Initial Demonstration and Manufacturing Phases to Deliver the Incremental Capability (Operational Capability 2). the Upgrade is Primarily a Software Upgrade that Adds Synthetic Simulation for Radar, Category 5 Missiles and Surface to Air Missile Threats.

An Initial Support Contract Was Placed in July 2008 to Provide Limited Support Capability for the Aircraft at RAF Valley until November 2009 when the Main in Service Contract will be Let.

## A.3. Progress United Kingdom Military Flying Training System

Contract Award for the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Was in May 2008. the Head Lease for the Military Flying Training System Headquarters Building Was Signed 17 April 2008.

Advanced Jet Trainer

The Combined Operational Capability 0 and Operational Capability 2 Development Programme is Progressing to Plan. on the Production Programme, BAE Systems are Behind the Contract Delivery Dates but Deliveries are Well Within Approval. Initial Spares Have Been Delivered to RAF Valley, Maintainers Have Been Trained, and Aircraft are Expected in April 2009. Negotiations are Underway with BAE Systems to Agree the Follow on in Service Support Contract Between November 2009 and April 2015.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Current Training System is Unable to Train Aircrew to the Standard Required, or to Provide Sufficient Aircrew to Meet Manning Requirements. Unless the Training System is Equipped to Provide the Skills Provided, Operational Effectiveness will be Seriously Degraded. the Legacy Training Aircraft are Fast Approaching their Out of Service Dates with Support Being more Costly and Difficult. There is a Belief that from 2007 the Current System will be Unable to Sustain the Front Line. Additionally the Introduction of a Triservice System will Enable Efficiencies in Time and Cost, Reducing the Amount of Time in Training and Increasing Aircrew Time in Active Service.

The Advanced Jet Trainer (Increment a) Delivers the Phase Four Training Element into the United

Kingdom Military Flying Training System Project. There is a Dependency on the United Kingdom Military

Flying Training System Project for the Provision of Ground Based Training Environment to Achieve IOC.
