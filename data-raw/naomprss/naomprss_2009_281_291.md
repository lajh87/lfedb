• Post Main Investment Decision - Watchkeeper

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Watchkeeper will Provide the Operational Commander with a 24 Hour, all Weather, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Capability Supplying Accurate, Timely and High Quality Imagery to Support Decision Making. the System will Consist of Unmanned Air Vehicles, Sensors, Data Links and Ground Control Stations. Watchkeeper is Planned to be Delivered Through an Incremental Programme to Allow the System to Benefit from both Existing and Developing Sensors and Air Vehicle Technology.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Watchkeeper is a Consolidation of the Sender and Spectator Projects. Initial Gate Approval Was Received for Sender in November 1999 and Approval for a Joint Assessment Phase for both Projects Was Given in July 2000.

The Acquisition Strategy Has Been Based on Selecting Unmanned Air Vehicle Systems to Suit a Defined Capability Requirement Rather than an Air Vehicle-Centred Approach. Through Evaluation and System Concept Demonstration, the Assessment Phase Has Driven Down Technical and Schedule Risks and Derived the Whole Life Costs Associated with the Proposed Options. User and System Requirements Were Identified and Revalidated. Trade-Off Activity Was Undertaken, Taking Full Account of the Impact Across all Lines of Development and Supported by Balance of Investment Studies.

Alternative Acquisition Options Have Been Considered. PPP/PFI Was not Deemed Appropriate for the Provision of a Tactical Capability Deployed in Theatre, Due to the Potential Risks to Contractor Personnel and the Required Levels of Availability as Well as Legal Implications. Collaboration Was Explored During the Early Stages of the Assessment Phase, but it Was not Possible to Align Requirements. There is Continuing Dialogue with and Between Allied Nations on Matters of Requirement Definition, Technology, Operational Experience and Acquisition. the Need for Significant System Integration with the Emerging Network Enabled Capability Requirements Led the Defence Procurement Agency and the Potential Contractors to Adopt an Incremental Approach to Delivery. This Approach also Supports the Force Readiness Cycle which Provides for a Phased Uplift of Capability at Discrete Intervals.

Opportunities to Enhance Watchkeeper Beyond the Full Operating Capability Have Been Considered During the Assessment Phase and will Inform Future Investment Decisions.

Following a Competitive Process, Thales (UK) Was Announced as Preferred Bidder in July 2004. the Programme Completed the Assessment Phase of the Acquisition Cycle in July 2005, when Main Gate Approval Was Given to Proceed to the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase.

## A.3. Progress

In July 2005, Following an International Competition, Thales (UK) Was Awarded the Watchkeeper Demonstration and Manufacture Phase Contract as Prime Contractor. Major Project Milestones Completed to Date Include the System Design Review in December 2005, the Preliminary Design Review in July 2006 and the Critical Design Review of the Air Vehicle in December 2006. the System Critical Design

Review Was Conducted in May 2007 and Finalised in September 2007 with the Completion of the De-Icing Critical Design Review

.

Watchkeeper’s Maiden Flight Took Place on 16 April 2008 in Israel and Was Followed by the Successful Achievement of the Automatic Take Off &
Landing System Demonstration in July 2008. the Programme is

On Target to Progress Capability to the UK at the End of 2009, where Test and Evaluations will be Conducted at Parc Aberporth in South Wales. Negotiations to Ensure that Watchkeeper Initial Operating Capability Remains on Schedule Have Jointly Been Identified and Successfully Contracted. Watchkeeper Support Solution is Expected to be on Contract by the End of 2009.

## A.4. Capability Risks.

Watchkeeper Replaces the Capability Previously Provided by Pheonix Unmanned Air Vehicle which Reached Its Out of Service Date in April 2008. the Hermes 450 Unmanned Air Vehicle Has Been Contracted on a Service Based Provision to Provide Continued Capability and Cover an Urgent Operational Requirement in Iraq and Afghanistan Prior to Watchkeeper Being Delivered into Service. if the Capability is not Acquired, UK Forces in Multi National Division (South East) will Face a Critical Shortfall in the Provision of Formation Level Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition & Reconnaissance

The Option Was Taken to Use the Existing Grass Strip at Upavon Rather than Build a Purpose Built Runway for Watchkeeper. Repetitive Use of a Grass Strip During Take-Off and Landing, Whilst Training, will Increase Air Vehicle Fatigue. Regular Deployment to an Airfield with a Hardened Strip and Adjacent Range Facilities Such as Boscombe Down or Aberporth is Planned to Minimise this Impact.

<td>the Requirement to Disseminate Watchkeeper Product Across the Battlespace Has Grown Beyond the Capacity of Bowman. There is Now a Need to Interoperate with the Deployed UK Core Network (Defence Information Infrastructure Future Deployed, Defence Information Infrastructure Current Deployed, Falcon, Cormorant and Reacher) to Allow Exploitation via the Dabinett Program and Urgent Operational Requirements that will Provide Early Capability Such as Attacker. This is Put at Risk by Dependency on Other Programmes as Well as a Required Change to the Watchkeeper Approach to Exchange of Information. the Need to Ensure that Watchkeeper Full Motion Video will be Accessible by Remote Video Terminal Users is Being Addressed by a Planning Round Enhancement Option to Achieve Initial Delivery by the Fourth Quarter of 2010.</Td>
