# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Joint Military Air Traffic Services Project Seeks to Sustain the Provision of Terminal Air Traffic

Management at MOD Airfields and Air Weapons Ranges Through the Provision of Mode S Secondary Surveillance Radar Data, Addressing Equipment Obsolescence in the Air Traffic Inventory and Through the more Efficient Delivery of Support Services. the Project will Provide Air Traffic Services to Military and Civilian Aircraft Arriving At, Departing from and Operating Within the Immediate Vicinity, or Confines Of, MOD Aerodromes (United Kingdom and Overseas Permanent and Deployed) and at Air Weapons Ranges.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

The Assessment Phase of the Joint Military Air Traffic Service is Being Conducted in Two Parts. the First Part (Assessment Phase 1) Was Approved on 17 January 2008. Its Purpose is Essentially to both Express the Provision of Military Air Traffic Services in Output Terms Through the Development of an Output Based Specification and to Determine the Most Appropriate and Cost Effective Delivery Solution for this Service. in Addition, the Project is Capturing Data on the Condition of the Existing Air Traffic Control Infrastructure (Control Towers, Radar Towers, Radio Masts Etc) as Well as the Number of People Employed in Supporting the Service. This Aspect of the Assessment Phase is Planned to Culminate in the Submission of a Review Note in October 2009.

This Approval is Planned to Initiate Part Two of the Assessment Phase Enabling Formal Industry Engagement. the Intention is to Use the Competitive Dialogue Process to Determine the Preferred Bidder and Solution to Deliver the Services Defined in the Output Based Specification Within the Delivery Framework Developed During Assessment Phase 1.

## A.3. Progress

Initial Gate Approval Was Obtained 17 January 2008 and Assessment Phase 1 is on Track to Complete on Time and Cost with the Submission of the Review Note Industry Engagement in October 2009. This will Seek the Approval of an Additional £6m to Provide Specialist Technical Support and External Assistance to the Competitive Dialogue Process.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Much of the Equipment that Currently Provides Air Traffic Services to MOD Airfields and Ranges is in Excess of 20 Years Old and is Obsolete. Increasing Regulation of UK Airspace Requires the Implementation of Mode S Secondary Surveillance Radar. Failure to Invest in this Capability will Ultimately Reduce the Level of Air Traffic Service Provision to These Locations. This will Reduce the Ability of all Three Services to Train and Fly and Hence the Ability to Project Air Power Whenever it is Required.
