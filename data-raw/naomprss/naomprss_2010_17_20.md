# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Department Requires an Effective and Efficient End-to-End Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Service. This will Provide Actionable Information and Intelligence to Inform Decision Makers Through a Capability that is Interoperable in a Joint, Inter-Agency, and Multinational Environment, in Support of an Agreed Range of Military Tasks Out to 2035. the Department Identified Capability Gaps in Two Areas: Direct, Process and Disseminate Relating to the Integrated Delivery of Intelligence; and Deep and Persistent Relating to Collection of Intelligence. the Dabinett Programme Was Established in Order to Address These Capability Gaps and in Doing so to Significantly Improve the Efficiency, Effectiveness, Quality and Timeliness of Intelligence Delivered to the Commander Primarily by Making Better Use of Legacy Systems but also Through the Introduction of New Capability Across all the Defence Lines of Development.

Background

Dabinett Was Originally Scoped as a Replacement to the Canberra PR9 Aircraft Used for Tactical Reconnaissance and Photographic Mapping. in 2005 the Acquisition for Network Enabled Capability and Dabinett Programme Integrated Project Team Was Formed to Deliver the Project. Lessons Identified from Theatre at this Time, Continued to Focus on the Inefficient Use of the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Inventory. Furthermore, Analysis from Operations in Iraq Indicated that Information Was Already Available to Answer 80- 90%
Of the Collection Requirements Raised. This Led to more Emphasis Being Placed on Dabinett to Improve the Intelligence,

Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Process, Direct, Collect, Process and Disseminate Rather than Merely Replacing a Tactical Reconnaissance and Photographic Mapping Aircraft.

In March 2010 Dabinett Was Renamed Solomon.

<th>the Programme is in a Continuous Assessment Phase that will Initiate a Number of Projects, with their Own Lifecycles, over Three Phases to Deliver over Time the Full Capability Identified for Dabinett. the First of These Projects is the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Information Integration &amp; Management Project which is Currently in Its Assessment Phase. a Through Life Capability Management Approach is Being Used to Manage the Dabinett Programme. Programme Support the £8m over Four Years Allocated to the Dabinett Programme Continuous Assessment Phase Element Has Been Used to Provide Technical Support to the Programme Such As:

Investigations.

## A.3. Progress

Dabinett is Currently Planned to Deliver over Three Phases.

Phase 1

The Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Information Integration &

Management Project is the Only Project in Phase 1 of the Programme. It Passed Initial Gate in April 2009. in February 2010 Two Competitive Assessment Phase Contracts Were Placed with Preferred Bidder Selection Expected in Late 2010.

Phase 2

Phase 2 will Provide Common Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Enabling Services, and Implement Improvements to Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Information Integration, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Management, and Intelligence Processing. in February 2010 a Decision Was Taken by the Direct Process and Disseminate Programme Board to Divert Planned Resources from this Phase to an Urgent Operational Requirement and Other Higher Priority Tasks. This Lead to a Capability Management Measure to Defer Funding for Phase 2 by Two Years. This Has Provided an Opportunity to Re-Plan Phases 2 and 3. This Re-Planning is Expected to Complete by December 2010.

Phase 3

The Deep and Persistent Element of Dabinett, Previously Planned for Phase 3, Has Been Split Out from the Direct Process and Disseminate Element and will Form Part of the Air Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Programme. Phase 3 of Dabinett will Therefore Only Consist of the Technology Refresh Activities.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Focus of the Dabinett Programme is on Improving the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the

Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Processes and Capabilities. Without Dabinett, Assets that Collect Intelligence will Continue to be Tasked to Answer Requests for Information and Intelligence that Already Exist Within the Intelligence Community. Dabinett will Meet the Deconfliction and Prioritisation Shortfalls of the Current UK Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Capability.

The Delivery of an Enhanced End to End UK Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Capability is Fundamental to the Success of Future Military Operations. Information and Intelligence is Essential in all Aspects of Modern Operations and Thus Provides the Bedrock for Decision Making. Dabinett will Ensure that Information and Intelligence is Effectively and Efficiently Available for Exploitation at all Levels of Command.
