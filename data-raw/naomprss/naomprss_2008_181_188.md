POST MAIN GATE PROJECT SUMMARY SHEET

WATCHKEEPER

Integrated Project Team Responsible:

TACTICAL UNMANNED AIR VEHICLE

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition & Reconnaissance)

Senior Responsible Owner for Broader Capability:

Assistant Chief of the Air Staff

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Watchkeeper will Provide the Operational Commander with a 24 Hour, all Weather, Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Capability Supplying Accurate, Timely and High Quality Imagery to Support Decision Making. the System will Consist of Unmanned Air Vehicles, Sensors, Data Links and Ground Control Stations. Watchkeeper is Planned to be Delivered Through an Incremental Programme to Allow the System to Benefit from both Existing and Developing Sensors and Air Vehicle Technology.

In July 2005, Following an International Competition, Thales (UK) Was Awarded the Watchkeeper Demonstration and Manufacture Phase Contract as Prime Contractor. Major Project Milestones Completed to Date Include the System Design Review in December 2005, the Preliminary Design Review in July 2006 and the Critical Design Review of the Air Vehicle in December 2006. the System Critical Design Review Was Conducted in May 2007 and Finalised in September 2007 with the Completion of the De-Icing Critical Design Review.

Key Future Events Include the Automatic Take Off & Landing System Demonstration which Has Been Rescheduled for June 2008, Taking into Account the Decision Made to Prioritise the Development of the Related Global Positioning Take-Off & Landing System for the Hermes 450 Urgent Operational Requirement.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Watchkeeper is a Consolidation of the Sender and Spectator Projects. Initial Gate Approval Was Received for Sender in November 1999 and Approval for a Joint Assessment Phase for both Projects Was Given in July 2000.

The Acquisition Strategy Has Been Based on Selecting Unmanned Air Vehicle Systems to Suit a Defined Capability Requirement Rather than an Air Vehicle-Centred Approach. Through Evaluation and System Concept Demonstration, the Assessment Phase Has Driven Down Technical and Schedule Risks and Derived the Whole Life Costs Associated with the Proposed Options. User and System Requirements Were Identified and Revalidated. Trade-Off Activity Was Undertaken, Taking Full Account of the Impact Across all Lines of Development and Supported by Balance of Investment Studies.

Alternative Acquisition Options Have Been Considered. PPP/PFI Was not Deemed Appropriate for the Provision of a Tactical Capability Deployed in Theatre, Due to the Potential Risks to Contractor Personnel and the Required Levels of Availability as Well as Legal Implications. Collaboration Was Explored During the Early Stages of the Assessment Phase, but it Was not Possible to Align Requirements. There is Continuing Dialogue with and Between Allied Nations on Matters of Requirement Definition, Technology, Operational Experience and Acquisition. the Need for Significant System Integration with the Emerging Network Enabled Capability Requirements Led the Defence Procurement Agency and the Potential Contractors to Adopt an Incremental Approach. This Approach also Supports the Force Readiness Cycle and Provides for a Phased Uplift of Capability at Discrete Intervals.

Opportunities to Enhance Watchkeeper Beyond the Full Operating Capability Have Been Considered During the Assessment Phase and will Inform Future Investment Decisions.

Following a Competitive Process, Thales (UK) Was Announced as Preferred Bidder in July 2004. the Programme Completed the Assessment Phase of the Acquisition Cycle in July 2005, when Main Gate Approval Was Given to Proceed to the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase.

## 5b. Cost of the Assessment Phase

| £m (Outturn Prices)       | Assessment Phase Cost | Proportion of Total Estimated Procurement Expenditure |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Actual Cost                   | 65                        | 7%                                                        |
| Approved Cost at Initial Gate | 52                        | 6%                                                        |
