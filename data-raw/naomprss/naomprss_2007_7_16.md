POST MAIN GATE PROJECT SUMMARY SHEET

A400M

Integrated Project Team Responsible:

A400M

Single Point of Accountability for project capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Expeditionary Logistics & Support)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

A400M is planned to provide tactical and strategic mobility to all three Services. The required capabilities include: operations from airfields and semi-prepared rough landing areas in extreme climates and all weather conditions by day and night; carrying a variety of equipment including vehicles and troops over extended ranges; air dropping paratroops and equipment; and being unloaded with the minimum of ground handling equipment. The Strategic Defence Review confirmed a requirement for an airlift capability to move large single items such as attack helicopters and some Royal Engineers’ equipment and concluded that this would be met, in the latter part of this decade, by Future Transport Aircraft. The A400M was selected to meet this requirement. It will replace the remaining Hercules C-130K fleet.

A400M is a collaborative programme involving seven European nations (Germany, France, Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and United Kingdom). A total of 180 aircraft (25 for UK) are being procured through a contract with Airbus Military Sociedad Limitada. The design phase is nearing completion and manufacture activities have commenced. First Flight is scheduled for 2008 and the first UK aircraft is scheduled to be delivered to the Royal Air Force in 2010.

## 3d. Cost resulting from ISD variation

| Type of Cost/Saving | Cost £m | Saving £m | Explanation                      |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Short Term Plan         | \+ 26       | \-            | Life extension of 14 C130K aircraft. |
| Total                   | \+ 26       |               |                                      |

## 3e. Operational impact of ISD variation

The Out of Service date of C130K aircraft has been extended to 2012, therefore no operational impact. This matches the planned capability build up of A400M.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Government announced in December 1994 that it would replace its ageing C-130K Hercules fleet, in part by procuring 25 C-130J’s from Lockheed Martin and in addition, subject to certain conditions, by rejoining the next phase of the collaborative Future Large Aircraft (FLA) programme (now known as A400M). The FLA ‘Initial Gate’ approval was achieved in July 1997 and in the same year the solution assumed for costing purposes was changed to an initial lease of four C-17 and subsequent procurement of 25 FLA. A Request For Proposals (RFP) was issued to Airbus in September 1997 on behalf of the seven FLA nations (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium,

Turkey). Subsequently, in July 1998, four nations (UK, France, Spain, Belgium) issued a “competitive RFP” for a Future Transport Aircraft (FTA) to Airbus Military Company (A400M), Boeing (C-17) and Lockheed Martin (C-130J).

Proposals were received on 29 January 1999 and parallel national and international assessments were undertaken. These covered Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisal, technical and commercial compliance, risk assessment, and an appraisal of the international and industrial dimensions. This work also led to parallel negotiations and clarification with the three bidders. At the direction of the Equipment Approvals Committee in December 1999, additional work was undertaken to inform the Main Gate submission. On 16 May 2000 the Government announced the decision to procure 25 A400M aircraft to meet the FTA requirement.
