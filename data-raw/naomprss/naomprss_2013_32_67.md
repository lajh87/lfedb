# A. Section A: The Project

# A.1 The Requirement

The military requirement is for up to 8 Astute Class Submersible Ship Nuclear to replace the existing Trafalgar Class of nuclear powered attack submarine.

Astute Class submarines are required to perform a range of military tasks; these unique requirements are combined within the Astute design to provide global reach, endurance, covertness, sustained high speed and the ability to conduct unsupported operations in hostile environments.

# A.2 The Assessment Phase

In June 1991 (equivalent of Initial Gate) approval was given to proceed with a programme of studies at an estimated cost of £6 million (1991/1992 prices) to define the Batch 2 Trafalgar Class Boat (now known as the Astute Class). This programme of studies led to the issue of an Invitation to Tender for the design and build of an initial batch of three Astute Class Submersible Ship Nuclear and a further approval of £2 million (1992/1993 prices) for contractor and Defence Research Agency support to MOD during the tendering exercise in 1994.

In July 1994, as a result of concerns over the overall affordability of the programme, Minister (Defence Procurement) and the Treasury approved a further £24 million (at 1993/1994 prices) for risk reduction studies to be undertaken in parallel with the formal bid phase of the project. To maintain an effective competition, contracts for risk reduction were awarded to both bidders, GEC Marconi (now BAE Systems (Submarine Solutions)) and Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd.

GEC-Marconi was identified as MOD’s preferred bidder in December 1995. Using the policy of No Acceptable Price No Contract, a Prime Contract was placed in March 1997 for the design, build and initial in service support of the first three of the Class.

# A.3 Project History

For Astute Class Programme historical data please refer to previous MPRs.

Approvals

On 20th July 2011 Her Majesty’s Treasury approved revised time and costs for Boats 1 to 4 and approved Main Build for boat 5, Initial Build for boat 6 and Long Lead Items for boat 7. At this time the Investment Approvals Committee also approved In-Service Dates for Boats 5, 6 and 7.

Boat 1 HMS ASTUTE

In June 2011 HMS ASTUTE successfully completed the UK phase of Contractor Sea Trials. While on a comprehensive sea trials programme in US waters the submarine successfully completed the first of class British Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles Firing Trials, final Spearfish deep discharge trials and underwater Magnetic Silencing; returning to Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde in March 2012 to commence Base Maintenance Period number 6, As a further element of the First of Class sea trials programme HMS ASTUTE has been fitted with a Payload Bay and will prove and demonstrate this additional capability during the next phase of sea trails.

Boat 2 AMBUSH

Boat 2 AMBUSH was launched and lowered in to the basin outside of the Devonshire Dock Hall on 6 January 2011. Fitting out of the submarine has been completed and the vessel is now undergoing a rigorous period of trials and testing prior to exiting the shipyard. The submarine successfully completed her first test dive in the shipyard’s basin in early October 2011. This is a critical milestone ahead of the Boat’s planned exit from Barrow.

Boats 3 to 5

Boat 3 ARTFUL continues construction in the Devonshire Dock Hall at Barrow and is making good progress with Diesel Generator Trials successfully completed in August 2011. It is anticipated that ARTFUL will leave the Devonshire Dock Hall in 2013 and exit Barrow approximately 12 months later to commence sea trials. Boat 4 AUDACIOUS; all hull and casing units have been moved to the Devonshire Dock Hall and a number of the internal equipment modules have also been shipped inside the respective units. First phase of reactor loop build was successfully completed and Main Propulsion Machinery Package shore trials have begun (pre-shipping). Two key pressure hull unitto-unit welds have commenced. Boat 5 ANSON had her ‘keel laid’ on 13th October 2011, at a traditional keel laying ceremony where the Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth unveiled a section of her hull.

ASTUTE CLASS TRAINING SERVICE

The Astute Class Training Service (ACTS) has provided training for the ships companies of both HMS ASTUTE and AMBUSH throughout the last twelve months. This year saw the first delivery of the Submariner Qualification course for the Royal Navy. A Formal Notice of Change was issued to the Training Service Provider, FAST Training Services Limited, for the inclusion of Boat 4

AUDACIOUS into the training service programme. On 15th February 2012 the Investment Approvals Committee approved the Astute Class Training Service Boat 4 Information Note which articulated a revised funding approach for the ACTS Boat 4 change delivering a saving against the 2007 Astute Class Training Service Boat 4 approval. Boat 4 will be placed on contract with FAST during 2013.

SUPPORT

Our revised approval sought to extend the principles and structure of the Initial Astute Support Solution model to Operational Handover (plus 3 months) for each of the 7 submarines. The additional 3 months post Operational Handover is to capture any residual transition costs that fall beyond the Operational Handover milestone for each submarine.

# A.4 In-year Progress

Approvals

On 8 Jun 12 Her Majesty’s Treasury approved the whole Astute Programme (Boats 1 – 7) and corresponding Astute Support Solution.

Boat 1 HMS ASTUTE

HMS ASTUTE has spent the year at sea concluding the majority of the extensive first of class sea trials programe, including demonstration of the full capability of the platform. An integral part of this is the Payload Bay capability which has now been proven and demonstrated its additional capability. It is planned to transfer the scheduling authority for the submarine (Operational Handover) on 25 April 2013, the submarine will then undergo a short maintenance period commencing 20 May 2013 and, subsequent Force Generation prior to operational tasking.

Boat 2 HMS AMBUSH exited the shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness on 15 September 2012 and undertook the initial platform proving phase of Contractors Sea Trials through to December 2012. Following a maintenance period at HM Naval Base Clyde, the submarine is continuing with the second, Capability Proving Sea Trial phase planned to complete end of July 2013. HMS AMBUSH reached Contract Acceptance Stage 1 Platform Demonstration, on 14 Dec 2012 from which point it has been managed as an In-Service Submarine under MOD rather than contractor direction. HMS Ambush was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy at HMNB Clyde on 1 Mar 2013, and is on schedule to achieve Operational Handover in May 2013

Boats 3 to 5

Boat 3 ARTFUL continues construction in the Devonshire Dock Hall at Barrow-in-Furness. A delay in supply of key Nuclear Steam Raising Plant components and a shortfall in volume of construction and outfit work againt the plan has prevented scheduled Core Load from being achieved. A number of performance improvement activities have been put in place by the contractor to ensure that the programme remains on track to achieve Operational Handover in 2015.

Boat 4 AUDACIOUS Submarine construction and outfit has continued in the Devonshire Dock Hall. The Whole Boat Contract , which introduces revised management arrangements and more robust terms aimed at driving delivery, was signed 01 Nov 2012.

Boat 5 ANSON The submarine has continued the open outfit stage in the Devonshire Dock Hall with some fabrication continuing in the New Assembly Shop.

Boats 6 and 7

Further tranches of material have been procured for Boat 6 and procurement of long lead items for boat 7 have commenced. Following receipt of Whole Programme approval in Jun 12 the programme has pursued a number of opportunities to batch buy materials for boats 5-7, delivering cost savings to the programme and protecting the later boats from the potential impact of material shortfalls.

ASTUTE CLASS TRAINING SERVICE

The Astute Class Training Service (ACTS) has continued to provide training for ships companies of both HMS ASTUTE and HMS AMBUSH and commenced training for the crew of ARTFUL. The training service provider, FAST, have submitted their bid for the addition of training for Boat 4 crews from May 2015.

SUPPORT

The Astute support solution continues to mature as further experience is gained from sea. Both HMS ASTUTE and HMS AMBUSH have been successfully maintained through intensive trials periods and further action is underway to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to support the submarines as they progress towards operational deployments.

# A.5 Capability Risks

Delivery of HMS ASTUTE is critical to the submarine’s readiness profile. HMS ASTUTE’s delay will result in the delayed introduction of improved capability over current classes. The Astute Class will also de-risk capability essential for an affordable Successor deterrent programme.

The Initial Astute Support Solution was approved in July 2006; it follows a traditional support model, but recognises Astute’s differences and introduces additional arrangements as appropriate. Provision has been made to employ the build contractor (BAE Systems) as the Astute Technical Authority; MOD will be the Approving Authority, with the Nuclear Propulsion Project Team responsible for the Nuclear Steam Raising Plant. MOD Equipment Project Teams will support specific equipments with Head of In-Service Submarine (Head of Submarine Production up to Operational Handover) maintaining a Platform focus and providing the flotilla wide single point of contact for Navy Command. Astute Class Maintenance at the waterfront will be conducted under existing Warship Support Modernisation Initiative arrangements. The Astute Class Training Service is a Private Finance Initiative contract, initially approved for 36 years to provide Astute Class specific training to the Royal Navy for Boats 1-3. Approval was given in 2007, to extend to a 38 year contract, to cover the life of Boat 4 and the contract for this scope will be in place by October 2013. Approval for later Boats will be considered during FY14/15 as part of the option set for the delivery of a coherent training solution led by Underwater Training Capability Programme. The revised approach was included as part of the whole programme approval in June 2011. MPR13 reports against the Astute Support Solution approved by HM Treasury in May 2012. This extends the principles of the Initial Astute Support Solution model to 3 months beyond the operational handover of each Astute class submarine. The end of the reporting of the Initial Astute Support Solution end date has been brought forward from December 2012 (the date originally set out in the approval) to March 2011 when the new approval support solution began. The approval value and costs of the Initial Astute Support Solution have been reduced to reflect this change. This approach has been agreed with the NAO.

Previously in MPR2012 Boat 6 had only Initial Build approved and Boat 7 had only Long Lead Items approved. Following the Astute Whole Programme approval in June 2012, all boats now have Full Build approved. This has resulted in an increase to the approval level stated in B.2. The total and in year variations are calculated on the total cost of the programme and includes those elements previous reported.
