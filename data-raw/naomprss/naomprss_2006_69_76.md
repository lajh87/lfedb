# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Strategic Defence Review Confirmed the Requirement to Provide the Joint Force 2000 (Joint Command for all Harrier Forces) with a Multi-Role Fighter/Attack Aircraft to Replace the Royal Navy Sea Harrier and the Royal Air Force Harrier GR7. Following United Kingdom Participation in the Concept Demonstration Phase of the Programme, the United States Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Was Selected to Meet the Requirement. a Tailored Main Gate Demonstration Approval Was Obtained in January 2001 for Participation in the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, along with £600m for Related Non-SDD Work, Leading to Signature that Month of the Associated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). of the Eight Non-United States Countries Participating in SDD, the United Kingdom is the Sole Level 1 Partner, Contributing \$2bn to this Phase and Obtaining Key Project Roles Within the JSF Joint Programme Office (JPO). the United States Placed the SDD Contract with the Prime Contractor, Lockheed Martin in October 2001 with the United Kingdom Playing a Major Role in the Down Selection Process.

In September 2002 the United Kingdom Selected the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) JSF Variant to Meet Our Requirement. a Review of the JSF Programme and the Viability of the STOVL Design Was Completed in January 2005, Confirmed that a Successful Programme of Weight Reduction Initiatives and Other Performance Enhancements Had Restored Confidence that the STOVL Design Should Remain the United Kingdom’s Planning Assumption. However this Position will be Revisited as Part of an Investment Approvals Board Submission in Summer 2006. Despite the Weight Reduction Effort, Two Key User Requirements (KUR) Remain at Risk.

KUR04 - Mission Performance: A Number of Mitigation Measures are Being Explored Including Further Weight Reduction, Propulsion Testing and Studies into Ship Borne Rolling and Vertical Landing (SRVL) and Throttle Push.

KUR06 – Logistic Footprint: Mitigation Action in Hand Through Support Equipment Design Optimisation, Improvements in Reliability and Maintainability.

The United Kingdom Continues to Exert Influence on the JSF Programme via Participation in the Design Process and Participated in the Critical Design Review Held in Early 2006, Leading to

Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL) First Flight in 2006 and STOVL First Flight in Early 2008.

Participation in the SDD Phase will Deliver the United Kingdom a Block 3 Aircraft with Air to Air and Air to Ground Capabilities as Required by the Joint Operational Requirements Document. Future Capability Upgrades, Including Block 4 will be Determined as Part of the Multilateral Negotiations which are Underway to Agree the Memorandum of Understanding for the Production, Sustainment and Follow on Development Phases of the Programme.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Approval Was Obtained in November 1996 to Enter the Concept Demonstration Phase (CDP) on the JSF Programme under an MOU Signed in December 1995. the Phase Began in November 1996 with Two Competing United States Prime Contractors (Boeing and Lockheed Martin) Designing Weapons Systems and Flying Demonstration Aircraft on which the Selection of the Preferred Bidder Was Based. the Phase Completed in October 2001 with the Announcement of Lockheed Martin as the Successful Bidder. Studies into Alternative Options to JSF to Meet the Requirement Were also Conducted but Were Rejected on Cost Effective Grounds. the Options Were United States F/A18E, French Rafale M, a
"Navalised" Eurofighter and an Advanced Harrier.

Note: For MG Development Approval, ISD Was Noted, not Approved

T H I S PAG E I S I N T E N T I O N a L LY B L a N K

[^1]: The JCA Main Gate (MG) Was Tailored for Development Only to Match the US Procurement Cycle. Unit Production Cost Approval will be Sought as Part of the MG Production Approval. This Approval will not be Sought until at Least December 2006 as Part of the MG Production Approval.

[^2]: The in Service Date (ISD) Approval will be Sought as Part of the Production Approval for LRIP B (Jan 2011)

[^3]: Three Point Estimates for the Production Phase Have yet to be Determined, as Costs are Dependant on the Final Aircraft Numbers.
