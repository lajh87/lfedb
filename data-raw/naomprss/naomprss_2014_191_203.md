# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The requirement for the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme is to sustain the capability of the Armoured Infantry within the balanced force against current and emerging threats, across the spectrum of conflict until the Warrior Out of Service Date. The Warrior Armoured Fighting Vehicle was brought into service in 1988 with an Out of Service Date of 2025.

The Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme consists of four main elements:

1\. Warrior Figtability Lethality Improvement Programme

(A new turret incorporating a fully stabilised automatic 40mm cannon)

The 40 mm Cased Telescopic Cannon and Ammunition System has been mandated as the weapon system for Warrior and procured by a joint Anglo-French project. The project is currently part way through qualification of the ammunition and cannon, concurrently the weapon system is being integrated into Warrior by Lockheed Martin UK, who will qualify the new turret.

1.  Enhanced Electronic Architecture

(Power generation and distribution enhancement and the introduction of a modern electronic architecture)

1.  Modular Protection System

(Applique Armour fixing points, enabling a 'tailored' armour solution to counter specific threats)

1.  Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle

(A new variant, replacing obsolescent platforms, that has equal protection and mobility to the core fighting platforms). Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle is currently in the Concept Phase and is subject to future approval.

The current affordable fleet is 565 vehicles including 445 currently planned to be upgraded to Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme which includes the intent to upgrade 65 to Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

<col style="width: 100%" />

<thead>
<tr>
<th>The Assessment Phase was conducted from the approval of Initial Gate (27 July 2009) to the contract effective date of 31 October 2011. A competition was run, with two bidders (BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin) invited to compete. After Initial Gate, the programme was given a compressed timeline of six months to gain Main Gate Approval, and a Business Case was submitted to the Investment Approval Board in February 2010. Affordability issues due to an over extended Defence Budget meant Main Gate Approval was not given, with the bidders requested to Revise and Confirm their bids against a range of options. In March 2010 the Investment Approvals Board approved an uplift of up to £12.4m to fund the extended Assessment Phase. The programme team resubmitted a Main Gate Business Case to the Defence Equipment and Support Investment Board on 11 July 2011, which was approved and submitted for the Investment and Approval Committee meeting on 19 July 2011. Approval was given by Her Majesty's Treasury on 4 October 2011 and then the Investment and Approvals Committee on 10 October 2011. The Prime Minister visited the Lockheed Martin facility in Ampthill, Bedfordshire on 25 October 2011 and made a public announcement regarding the placement of the contract with Lockheed Martin. The Contract for the Demonstration Phase was signed on 31 October 2011. Within the Warrior approval, the 40mm Cannon was the mandated weapon system (March 2008) which would enable commonality with the Specialist Vehicles Programme, thus benefiting from common ammunition and training. A Review Note for the 40mm Cannon went to the Investment Approvals Board in March 2010 and was approved in April 2010. Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle is currently in the Concept Phase, with an Equipment Programme funding line of £107M included in Annual Budgeting Cycle14 to support procurement of 65 vehicles covering two different variants, an Armoured Personnel Carrier variant and an Ambulance variant.</th>

Qualification for the 40mm Case Telescoped Weapon System is led by the Scout - Specialist Vehicles team. Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle is currently in the Concept Phase to support procurement of 65 vehicles covering two different variants, an Armoured Personnel Carrier variant and an Ambulance variant.</th>

## A.4. In-Year Progress

Following slower than expected progress by the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme Prime Contractor a re-baselining of the Demonstration Phase schedule was required. The contract was reset following a period of negotiation. Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme remained within financial approvals and protected our approved In Service Date of March 2020 at 85% by amending the sequencing of Manufacture Phase activities, including the purchase of long lead items.

The following milestones have been achieved by Lockheed Martin in-year:

March 2013 – Unit Zero Turret Integration & Test {Turret Factory Acceptance Test Plan / Specification complete and approved. Integration
& Test Point A1 Test Report completed and any resultant corrective actions agreed}

November 2013 – Unit Zero Integration Readiness Review {Integration Readiness Review held}

December 2013 – Unit Zero Block 1 – Integration of Test Point A2, Stage 2 {Integration & Test Point A2 completed in accordance with Test Plan}

December 2013 – FV510 & FV511 Preliminary Design Review (Anchor)
{Conduct FV510 & FV511 Preliminary Design Review in accordance with and meet the criteria in the Systems Engineering

Management Plan}

March 2014 – Re-baseline Contract signed.

March 2014 – Live Fire 3 Stage 1 – Unmanned Fire Torque Measurement
{Trial to include unmanned firing of the Primary Weapon System integrated onto the Warrior Hull in the configuration and at the build standard}.

Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle:

Initial Gate was planned for Quarter 3 2014, however, Army Headquarters is currently reviewing the scope of the Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle programme with a view to harmonising the requirement across the broader Army programme. Both the quantity of vehicles and the number of variants required for Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicle are expected to increase as a consequence of this review and Defence Equipment &
Support are awaiting an option detailing the Army’s requirement

MAIN WEAPON SELECTION – Case Telescoped 40mm Cannon:

The qualification of Case Telescoped 40mm Cannon and Armour Piercing Fin Stabilised Discarding Sabot-Tracer and Target Practice-Tracer rounds continued in 2013 and included tests on the cannon and ammunition which included safety and functional trials in ambient and extreme hot and cold conditions. In addition, the ammunition was sequentially vibrated, shocked, heated, frozen and dropped to a specification which simulated a very tough in-service life, before being inspected and fired. The final qualification trials were completed in December 2013, forming the evidence in the Safety and Environmental Case Report which is currently with the Ordinance Safety Review Panel for their recommendation that Case Telescoped 40mm Cannon and Ammunition is safe to use. Some minor limitations have been applied in the initial use period, which will be lifted once further evidence or improvements have been provided as part of the ‘gap closure’ activities

## A.5. Capability Risks

Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme will upgrade the current Warrior fleet, some of which have been upgraded through a series of modifications and Urgent Operational Requirements. The current fleet is now restricted in it's capability on operations. The Out of Service Date for the non Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme Warrior fleet is 2025, so Warrior must be upgraded to avoid a long-term capability gap opening up.
