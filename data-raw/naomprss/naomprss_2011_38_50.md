AIRSEEKER

1.  Section A: The Project

1.  the Requirement

Project Airseeker (Formerly Known as Helix) Seeks to Sustain the UK’s Airborne Electronic Surveillance Capability Provided by the Nimrod R1 Aircraft and Associated Ground Elements, Against an Evolving and Increasingly Complex Target Set Up to 2025. It will Provide a Rapidly Deployable Capability to Support Operations where it will be Able to Collect, Analyse, Fuse and Disseminate a Coherent and Readily Interpretable Electronic Surveillance Picture in Support of National, Joint and Coalition Operations. This Information will Support Targeting and Combat Identification.

1.  the Assessment Phase

<th>whilst the Original Concept of the Project Was for the Procurement of a Modern Mission System to Fit into Existing Nimrod R1 Aircraft, in the Run Up to Initial Gate Approval, Other Platform Options Were Introduced and Were Subject to Detailed Assessment During Development of the Main Gate Business Case. the Assessment also Considered Ground Analysis Facilities, Training Facilities and a Support Solution to the Planned Out of Service Date of 2025. the Project Received Initial Gate Approval in August 2003 . Eight Contractors Were Invited to Participate in a Capability-Based Assessment and Three Were Chosen to Go Forward to a Competitive-Based Three-Stage Assessment Phase in April 2004. the First Stage Required the Contractors to Show their Understanding of the Requirement, and Resulted in a Down-Select to Two Contractors in April 2005. in the Second Stage the Remaining Two Contractors Were Required to Define the System to Meet the Capability, Proving their Design Through Operational Effectiveness Modelling. This Resulted in a Down-Select to a Preferred Contractor in April 2007. When the Down-Selected Contractor Commenced the Final Stage of the Assessment Phase, a Risk Reduction Exercise, it Became Evident that the Cost of Supporting the Nimrod R1, as the Planned Host Platform, Was Likely to be Significantly Greater than Anticipated. Due to this Cost Escalation a Change in Strategy Was Made in 2008 to Focus the Remainder of the Assessment Phase on an Investigation of an Alternative to the Nimrod R1 as the Host Platform. Work Was Undertaken to Obtain a Robust Performance, Time and Cost Envelope and a Main Gate Business Case Was Submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in December 2009 Recommending Procurement of the United States Air Force Rivet Joint System under a Foreign Military Sales Arrangement. After Defence Board Consideration of the Project’s Cost and Programme Assumptions Within the Context of the Department’s 2010 Financial Planning Round, the Main Gate Business Case Was Updated Through a Review Note and an Addendum. the Investment Approvals Board Approved the Updated Business Case in March 2010.</Th>

1.  Progress

As from 1st April 2010 Helix Became Known as Airseeker.

A Letter of Offer and Acceptance Was Signed on Behalf of the UK Government on 19 March 2010 which Included a Request for the USA Government to Prepare and Submit a Revision to that Letter Reflecting the

Planning Round 2010 Settlement. Their Formal Response Was Received on 28 October 2010. Investment

Approvals Board Approval to Sign the Revised Offer Letter Was Received on 24 March 2011. the Revised Letter of Offer and Acceptance Was Signed on Behalf of the UK Government on 24 March 2011 . the Revision to the Offer Letter Has Been Augmented by Additional Information on How the USA Government Program Office, Known as Big Safari, Intends Making Contractual Commitments on Behalf of the UK. the US Government Has Been Implementing the Initial Stages of the Foreign Military Sales Agreement in Accordance with a Plan that is Consistent with the Planning Round 2010 Settlement. a Major Milestone Was Achieved on 14 December 2010 when the First Donor Aircraft for Conversion to Become the First UK Rivet Joint Aircraft Was Taken into Work at the USA Facility in Texas.

Project Summary Sheet

AIRSEEKER

In September 2010, Royal Air Force Headquarters Air Command Signed an Agreement Known as the Comanning Memorandum of Understanding with the Operational Wing of the US Air Force that Operates the Rivet Joint Aircraft and Ground Systems. This Agreement Makes Provision for UK Crews to be Trained by the US Air Force, Funded under the Foreign Military Sales Case that is Managed by the Airseeker Project Team, and then Allocated to Operational Duties by the US Air Force Rivet Joint Commander. the First of the RAF Personnel Started Training in January 2011, with the First Graduates Ready for Operational Rivet Joint Deployments in June 2011. This Conversion Training and Operational Experience will Provide the Required Quantity of Trained Manpower to Meet the Initial Operating Capability Whilst Significantly De-Risking the Training Defence Line of Development.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Loss of the Capability to be Provided by Project Airseeker Would Remove the UK’s Ability to Conduct Theatrelevel Airborne Electronic Surveillance in the Future. UK Forces Would be Denied the Ability to Acquire Timely Intelligence from Increasingly Complex and Rapidly Changing Electronic Sources in the Theatre Domain. This Would Significantly Reduce the Ability to Acquire, Process and Disseminate Signals, Communications and Electronic Intelligence to UK and Coalition Partners. Critically, the Principal Source of Tactical Data Essential to the Nature of Current Operations Would be Lost, Substantially Reducing the Ability to Conduct Effective Targeting and Information Operations.

All Through-Life Support Activities will be Covered under a Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Sustainment and Follow-on Development. the Conduct of the Co-Operative Support Programme under this Memorandum of Understanding will be Governed by a Joint Steering Committee. a Co-Operative Programme Office will be Established at the Main Contractor’s Facility in Greenville, Texas to Manage Day to Day Maintenance and Support of the Combined Fleet Together with Management of the Through-Life Upgrade Programme. the UK and US will Jointly Man the Co-Operative Programme Office on the Basis of the Proposed Cost Share. Depth Maintenance will be Based at the Main Contractor’s Facility in Greenville, Texas which Currently Forms the Support Hub for the US Air Force Fleet of Rivet Joint Aircraft. the Memorandum of Understanding is Currently in a Mature Draft Form and is Being Staffed Within USA and UK Government Departments Prior to Signature.
