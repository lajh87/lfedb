# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1 The Requirement

The Type 45 is a new class of six Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers, to replace the capability provided by the Royal Navy’s existing Type 42s. The warship is being procured nationally. The Type 45 will carry the Principal AntiAir Missile System which is capable of protecting the vessels and ships in their company against aircraft and missiles, satisfying the Fleet’s need for area air defence capability into the 2030s. The Principal Anti-Air Missile System is being procured collaboratively with France and Italy. The Destroyers Team is responsible for providing the Principal Anti-Air Missile System to the warship Prime Contractor.

## A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Type 45 Destroyer programme builds on the Assessment work carried out in Phase 1 of the collaborative Horizon project, the warship element of the Common New Generation Frigate programme. Following the decision of the three Horizon partners (France, Italy and the United Kingdom) to proceed with the Principal Anti-Air Missile System, but to pursue national warship programmes, BAE Systems was appointed Prime

Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999. The contract for the Principal Anti-Air Missile System Full Scale Engineering Development and Initial Production was placed in August 1999. Main Gate approval for the warship was achieved in July 2000 and a contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture was placed in December 2000.

## A.3 Progress

BAE Systems Electronics was appointed Prime Contractor for the Type 45 in November 1999 and a contract for Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture for the first three ships was placed in December 2000. A contract for a further three Type 45 hulls was placed with the Prime Contractor in February 2002. The ships are being built under sub-contract by BAE Systems Surface Fleet Ltd. The Demonstration &
Manufacture contract was amended to reflect the Investment Approvals Board Six-Ship Approval gained in August 2007. This change has introduced a staged acceptance process for each ship which commences with Acceptance off Contract, thereby giving control of the vessel to the MOD to undertake a further period of trials and acceptance activity leading to the declaration of In-Service Date. It was announced in June 2008 that as part the Department’s 2008 Planning Round the decision was taken not to take up the option to proceed with Typ 45 Ships 7 and 8.

During the Department’s 2010 Planning Round a decision was taken to amend the production programme of

Aster Missiles. This decision deferred production of some missiles, reducing costs in early years, but addin

£46m to the overall cost of the Principal Anti-Air Missile System programme. However, the effect of other Planning Round decisions in 2010 and the benefits accrued through the good progress of the Ship programm meant that the result was no overall cost growth of the Type 45 programme.

The past year has seen significant progress across the Type 45 programme with two ships now declared InService. The first ship, HMS Daring was accepted into service with the Royal Navy on 31 July 2010, with the second ship, HMS Dauntless, being similarly accepted on 16 November 2010. Good progress continues to achieved across the build programme with the third ship, HMS Diamond being accepted off contract on 22

September 2010 and the fourth ship, HMS Dragon completing her first contractor sea trials in December 201 The final Type 45, HMS Duncan, was launched in October 2010. The Principal Anti-Air Missile System development test firing programme was successfully completed in June 2010 with a Salvo firing from the Longbow barge at a French test range in the Mediterranean. The High Seas Firing programme from Type 45 platforms commenced with a successful firing from HMS Dauntless in September 2010 at the UK Hebrides test range.

The contract for up to seven years of Support for Type 45, awarded to BAE Systems Surface Ships Ltd in September 2009, has delivered the required availability to enable those ships declared in-service to achieve their programmed activities.

During the Department’s 2011 Planning Round savings measures were implemented as a result of the combination of forecast Terms Of Business Agreement savings, risk retirement following successful completion of the Sea Viper development firing programme and early In-Service Date of the first two ships an early acceptance off-contract of the third ship against their 50% confidence dates. As a result of these savings, which amounted to some £34m, the decision was taken to reverse a Cost Capability Trade made in 2006 that proposed to reduce the spend on Aster missiles by some £30m. The overall effect of these decisions and the change in Departmental policy with respect to Cost of Capital is a forecast decrease of £30m in the overall cost of the programme.

## A.4 Capability Risks

In order for a force of ships to operate safely at sea and project power onto the land, it has to reduce its susceptibility to attack from the air. The current generation of anti-air warfare capability (Type 42 Destroyer) has already been extended beyond its design life and is now rapidly approaching its Out of Service Date. The Type 45 Destroyer will ensure that UK maritime forces retain a sufficiently robust capability to counter the growing threat from the air for the next 25 years. Without the Type 45, the UK would be severely limited in its ability to operate maritime forces in all but the most benign environments. There would also be a significant shortfall in the number of ships available to deploy world-wide in support of wider British interests, fulfilling roles from defence diplomacy to disaster relief to crisis intervention.

There are 3 broad layers to Type 45 Destroyer support:

<ol type="a">
<li>Interim Support (Support to Stage 2 Trials) covers the period from the First of Class (HMS Daring) Acceptance off Contract to In-Service Date. The change to ship acceptance approved as part of wider programme re-approval in August 2007 advances the date that the First of Class is accepted off contract, consequently requiring interim support arrangements to be put in place until In-Service Date. Funding for Interim Support was approved under the Six Ship Approval and costs are reported against the Demonstration &amp; Manufacture phase costs for Type 45, hence this element is not reported further within the Support section. The Interim support contract completed at In-Service Date for HMS Daring. For the other five Type 45s support to Stage 2 Trials will be provided under the Full Support contract, although, as above, funding was approved under the Six Ship Approval and costs are reported against the Demonstration &amp; Manufacture phase costs for Type 45.</li>
<li>Type 45 Initial Spares (Industrial Investment and Long Lead spares). Purchase of long-lead spares and industrial mobilisation activities for which contracts needed to be placed ahead of the Type 45 Full Support Solution (see c. below) in order to be available for In-Service Date. The Approval did not set any Time limits for contract end dates, therefore only progress against Cost boundaries is reported within the Support section.</li>
<li>Full Support. Phase 1 of the long term support strategy is the delivery of a Class wide Type 45 Support Solution through a single source incentivised contract with BAE Systems Surface Fleet Ltd as the support integrator for Type 45. Support will then migrate into the Surface Ship Support Programme (SSSP). The Full Support contract for the warship (the Phase 1 work described above) was placed in September 2009. It includes the activities to establish the support solution infrastructure and team and then to provide up to 7 years In-Service support. Support to the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) will be provided by a separate single source incentivised contract with MBDA (UK). Negotiations for this contract are ongoing.</li>

Impact of slippage to SAMPSON programme and measures taken to mitigate the full impact of that delay (+3 months). Assessment based on full timescale risk analysis (conducted jointly with BAE Systems) which gave a most likely date of March 2010, based on baseline programme.
