# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

In 2004, the Apache Army Helicopter Mk1 Support Reappraisal Project identified options to achieve significant Whole Life Cost savings over the service life of the aircraft to 2031. One of these options was the Modernised Target Acquisition and Designation Sight programme. The Modernised Target Acquisition and Designation Sight Programme upgrades four existing systems on the Apache Army Helicopter Mark 1 with the aim of reducing the aircraft’s Whole Life Cost through overcoming obsolescence and improving reliability. In addition, the Modernised Target Acquisition and Designation Sight Programme will increase operational capability through the introduction of second generation infra red technology in the Modernised Target Acquisition and

Designation Sight and the Modernised Pilot’s Night Vision Sensor. The Modernised Target Acquisition and Designation Sight, Pilot’s Night Vision Sensor and Target Acquisition and

Designation Sight Electronic Display And Control upgrades are already fielded with the United States Army. The Improved Helmet Display and Sighting System for the 21st Century is scheduled to be fielded with the United States Army at a later date.

Trials of the Modernised Target Acquisition and Designation Sight upgrade on British Army Apache Army Helicopter Mark 1s are ongoing with two aircraft undergoing trials at

AgustaWestland Helicopters Ltd, Yeovil. A further aircraft was modified in early 2008 to ensure compatibility with Operation HERRICK theatre entry standard modifications. Aviation Training International Ltd are also under contract to provide the associated upgrades to the Attack Helicopter Training System. Modification of the wider Apache Army Helicopter Mk1 fleet and the enhancement of the Attack Helicopter Training System to include Modernised Target Acquisition and Designation Sight training is on schedule to commence in the last quarter of 2008 to support an In-Service Date of April 2009.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Modernised Target Acquisition and Designation Sight project was initiated as a result of the Assessment Phase of the Attack Helicopter Support Reappraisal Project. The Attack Helicopter Support Reappraisal Project sought to achieve £738m (hard target) Whole Life Cost saving over the service life of the aircraft to 2031. The Attack Helicopter Support Reappraisal Project was structured in two phases, an analysis of “spend to save” Investment Options and an improved Future Support Arrangement. The Modernised Target Acquisition and Designation Sight Programme was estimated to contribute whole life cost savings of
£464m.
