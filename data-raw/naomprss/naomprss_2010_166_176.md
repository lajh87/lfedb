• Post Main Investment Decision – QUEEN ELIZABETH CLASS

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Requirement for the Queen Elizabeth Class Was Endorsed in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review which Identified a Continuing Need for Rapidly Deployable Forces with the Reach and Self-Sufficiency to Act Independently of Host-Nation Support. the Strategic Defence Review Concluded that the Ability to Deploy Offensive Air Power Would be Central to Future Force Projection Operations, with Carriers Able to Operate the Largest Possible Range of Aircraft in the Widest Possible Range of Roles. This Analysis Was Further Endorsed by the New Chapter Work of 2002 and the Defence White Paper in December 2003. the Current Invincible Class of Carriers Was Designed for Cold War Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations. with Helicopters and a Limited Air-Defence Capability Provided by a Relatively Small Number of Embarked Sea Harriers, it Was Judged that this Capability Would No Longer Meet Future United Kingdom Requirements. It Was Therefore Decided to Replace the Invincible Class with Two Larger and more Capable Aircraft Carriers. the Class’s Offensive Air Power will be Provided Primarily by the Joint Combat Aircraft. the Joint Force Air Group is an Air Group Comprising of a Mix of Aircraft, Tailored to the Mission Need; it will Typically Consist of both Fixed and Rotary-Winged Aircraft Including Joint Air Assets E.g. Joint Combat Aircraft.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

The Class Received Initial Gate Approval in December 1998 and Invitations to Tender Were Issued in

January 1999. Following Tender Evaluation, Competitive Firm Price Contracts for the Assessment

Phase, Each Potentially Worth some £30m, Were Awarded to BAE Systems and Thales UK in November 1999. Initially, the Assessment Phase Was Broken Down into Two Stages. the First Involved the Examination of Several Carrier Designs, and Helped Inform the Decision in January 2001 to Select the United States Joint Strike Fighter as the Option with Best Potential to Meet the Joint Combat Aircraft Requirement. Stage 1 Completed in June 2001, Following which Proposals from the Contractors for Stage 2 Were Considered, Together with an Assessment of their Views on the Level of Work Needed to Adequately De-Risk the Programme. After Careful Consideration, the Conclusion Was Reached that the Original Two-Stage Approach No Longer Offered Value for Money and the Assessment Phase Strategy Was Changed.

The Competitive Second Stage Was Revised and Shortened (Completing in November 2002) and Enabled the Competing Contractors to Concentrate on Refining their Designs and Taking Key Trade-Off Decisions. an Innovative Continuous Assessment Process Was Used Throughout to Evaluate the Contractors' Performance which Led to the Conclusion that an Alliance Approach Involving BAE Systems, Thales UK and the Department Represented the Best Approach to Future Aircraft Carrier. the Innovative Alliance Procurement Strategy Enabled the Full Exploitation of the Resources and Strengths of the Alliance Participants with the Shared Objective of Improving on Agreed Performance Targets and Was Announced in January 2003. a Third Stage of Assessment Was Therefore Taken Forward on this Basis to Further Increase the Maturity of the Design and Determine the Alliancing Strategy for Future Aircraft Carrier. Stage 3 Completed in March 2004.

In July 2004, the Assessment Phase Was Extended into Stage 4 to Further Mature the Design and Carry Out Risk Reduction Work, to Ensure that the Best Technical & Procurement Solution Was Achieved.

Alliancing Principles Were Agreed with BAE Systems and Thales UK and Further Developed with the Selection in February 2005 of Kellogg, Brown
& Root UK Ltd as an Additional Participant in the Alliance. the Timescale for Completing the Design and Risk Reduction Work Was Further Extended in

August 2005 (into Stage 5) Although this Did not Result in any Additional Cost to the Programme. the

Assessment Phase Completed at the End of January 2006 at a Revised Total Cost of £331m[^1], (Following Receipt of Interim Cost Certificates[^2]
From the Alliance Participants). Final Assessment Phase Figure will be Confirmed Upon Receipt of Final Cost Certificates.

## A.3. Progress

Following Direction from the Investment Approvals Board, the Project Has Adopted an Incremental Approach to Main Gate Approval with the Demonstration and Manufacturing Phases Being Divided into Two Sequential Main Gate Approval Points. the First Phase (Demonstration), which Included Expanding the Alliance to Include Babcock Engineering Services and VT Shipbuilding, Was Approved by the Investment Approvals Board and Treasury in December 2005. the Total Cost of the

Demonstration Phase (Excluding Indirect Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit, but Including Non Recoverable VAT) Was Approved at
£297m (not to Exceed). the Demonstration Phase Activity Completed in Mid 2008 with Total Expenditure to 31^st^ March of £266m. the Second and Final Main Gate Approval, to Proceed with the Manufacturing Phase of the Project Was Announced by Secretary of State on 25^th^ July 2007 at a not to Exceed Cost of £3900m Including the Capitalised Assessment Phase Costs and Demonstration Phase Costs.

In March 2006, the UK Agreed a Memorandum of Understanding that Provides for the Supply to France of a Common Baseline Design Data Pack to Enable French Industry to Bid for the Design, Manufacture and Support of One Future Aircraft Carrier (France). France Has Paid an Initial Entry Fee and Contributed to the Costs of the UK Demonstration Phase.

At the Time of the Main Gate in 2007, the Build Strategy Called for One of the Lower Blocks to be Constructed at the BAE Systems Submarines Yard in Barrow-in-Furness. BAE Systems Needed to Build a New Facility - The Central Assembly Shop - In Order to Accommodate the Construction of the Block. It Was Envisaged at the Time that the Facility Would also be Beneficial to the Future Submarine Programme. MOD Authorised BAE Systems to Begin Site Work in June 2007. in July 2008 the Alliance Management Board Agreed to the Reallocation of Lower Block 3 to the A&P Tyne Yard on a

‘best for Project’ Basis and in December 2008 the Aircraft Carrier Alliance Formally Instructed BAE Systems to Terminate the Contract and Fully Justify any Incurred Costs. It Was Hoped that the Work Carried Out in Barrow Would be of Use to the Future Submarine Programme, However this Did not Come to Fruition which Led to a Write-Off of £8m in Financial Year 2009-10.

Following Main Gate Approval the Project Moved into the Engineering Transition Phase, an Extension of the Demonstration Phase to Encompass the Period Prior to Contract Signature. on 3^rd^ July 2008 a Contract Was Signed with BVT Surface Fleet for the Manufacture of the Two Carriers Together with Signature of an Alliance Agreement with all Members of the Alliance.

On 11 December 2008, Ministers Announced the Outcome of MOD’s Equipment Examination Including the Intention to Re-Profile the Queen Elizabeth Class Project to Meet Near Term Priorities and Improve the Scope of Alignment with the Joint Combat Aircraft Programme. the Re-Profiling Measure Removed £450m from Years 1 to 4 and Delayed in Service Dates by 1 and 2 Years. the Cost Estimates of the Impact of the Examination on the Project Were Approved by the MOD in February 2010.

The First Cut of Steel Took Place in July 2009 at the Govan Shipyard in Glasgow, and Manufacture is Underway in Five UK Shipyards: Babcock Rosyth and Appledore, BAE System Govan, Portsmouth and A&P Tyne. This Work will Expand to the Final Shipyard in 2010. Current in Service Date Estimates are May 2016 for HMS Queen Elizabeth and December 2018 for HMS Prince of Wales.

During 2009 a Number of Significant Milestones Were Achieved:
Completion of No.1 Dock at Rosyth; Delivery of an Upper Deck Section from Appledore to Rosyth; Delivery of the Highly Mechanised Weapon Handling System and the Delivery of Emergency Diesel Generators.

In Addition the Preparations and Equipment Procurement Have Proceeded with Equipment Subcontracts Placed to Date in Excess of £1000m, at the Close of the Financial Year in March the Bow of the Queen Elizabeth Departed from Appledore for Rosyth.

The Aircraft Carrier Alliance Acknowledged that There Was a Requirement to Reduce Costs at the Time of Contract Award on the Basis that Concerted Management Action in the Early Years of the Project Would Allow this to Reduce. in the Event, the Disruption Caused by Initial Recosting Activity and then the Equipment Examination Prevented Successful Delivery of the Originally Planned Cost Reduction - As this Would not be Achieved, MoD Considered it Prudent to Formally Recognise this in Its Revised Estimate.

At the End of March 2010 the Final Target Cost Figure for the Queen Elizabeth Class Was Estimated to be £5254m, Giving a Total Forecast Cost of £5900m Including Associated Cost of Capital. Negotiations are Ongoing and the Contractual Final Target Cost is Due to be Agreed with the Aircraft Carrier Alliance by December 2010.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Class Is, Together with Joint Combat Aircraft, Maritime Airborne Surveillance & Control and Maritime Auxiliary Replenishment Ships, an Essential Element of the Carrier Strike Programme: The Ability to Project Air Power from the Sea and Capable of Projecting the Full Level of Medium Scale Offensive Air Effort and Precision Strike from the Sea. Medium Scale is Defined as a Deployment of Brigade Size or Equivalent for Warfighting or Other Operations. an Example Would be Our Contribution to the NATO-Led Intervention Force in Bosnia.

Joint Combat Aircraft Maritime Capability Depends on the Queen Elizabeth Class to Achieve Carrier Strike.

Risks Associated with the Final Achievement and Successful Delivery of Carrier Strike are Held and Managed by Senior Responsible Officer (Carrier Strike) and Managed on His Behalf by the 1\ Carrier Strike Co-Ordination Group. the Individual Project Teams Manage Risks to the Timely Delivery of their Component Parts of this Larger Capability but not the Final Outcome. Queen Elizabeth Class Risks are Managed via the Standard Risk Process with any Holistic Carrier Strike Issues Being Elevated Through Standard Through Life Capability Management Route.

The Full Operational Capability will be Largely Determined by the Combination of Joint Force Air Group Elements and the Queen Elizabeth Class Incremental Acquisition Plan. Full Operating Capability will Therefore be Defined Once the Joint Combat Aircraft and Maritime Airborne Surveillance &amp; Control Delivery Programmes and the Initial Approved Plan are Agreed. Full Operating Capability will Allow Queen Elizabeth Class to Have an Embarked Joint Force Air Group and a Level of Capability Equivalent to that Declared at Main Gate.
