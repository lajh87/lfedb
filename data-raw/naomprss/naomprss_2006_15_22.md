# SECTION 1: ABOUT the PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The Astute Class of Attack Submarines is the Replacement for the Existing Swiftsure and Trafalgar Classes of Nuclear Attack Submarine. the Required Capability Places Greater Emphasis on Land Attack, Intelligence Gathering and Special Forces Operations. GEC-Marconi (Now BAE Systems Electronics Ltd – Astute Class Project) Was Identified as MOD’s Preferred Bidder in December 1995. a Prime Contract Was Placed in March 1997 for the Design, Build and in Service Support of the First Three of the Class.

Following BAE Systems’ Disclosure During 2002 of Significant Delay and Projected Cost Overrun on the Astute Programme, the Department Entered into Discussions with the Company About Arrangements to Address Those Difficulties. an Agreement Between the Department and BAE Systems Was Reached in February 2003 which Reduces Risk (Eg by Separating the Design, Development, Build and Acceptance of the First of Class from the Production of the Second and Third Submarines), and Places New Incentives on the Company to Perform. the Department Agreed to Increase Its Cash Funding for Astute by Around £430 Million, Against an Increased Contribution by the Company of £250 Million. the Department’s Contribution is Primarily in Recognition of the Greater than Expected Difficulty in Applying

Computer Aided Design (CAD) Techniques to United Kingdom Submarines. an Amendment to the Astute Contract to Enact the Agreement Was Signed in December 2003. Since the Agreement, all the Programme’s Anchor Milestones Have Been Met and New Project Management Disciplines Have Been Implemented to Achieve Better Planning and Performance Monitoring.

Risk Analysis, Taking into Account Opportunities to Reduce Construction Time, Predicts a Most Likely InService Date of December 2008; However, BAE Systems are Determined to Bring this Date Forward to August 2008. All Three Submarines are Now in Build and Production Targets for Them are Stable. Overall Programme Cost is Being Examined and Work is Proceeding on a Number of Fronts to Deliver Cost Reductions Inclusive of Joint Work with BAE Systems to Secure a Price for the Second and Third Submarines.

## 3e. Operational Impact of ISD Variation

The Astute Delay will Result in the Delayed Introduction of Improved Capability over Current Classes; Such as Improved Detection, Greater Weapon Load and Increased Availability. Since These Delays the

Department Has Considered Fully the Plans for SSN Capability in the Light of this and many Other Factors.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP to MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Astute Class of Submarines is the Planned Replacement for the Swiftsure and Trafalgar Class SSNs. in June 1991, (Equivalent of Initial Gate) Approval Was Given to Proceed with a Programme of Studies at an Estimated Cost of £6m (1991/1992 Prices) to Define the Batch 2 Trafalgar Class Boat (Now Known as the Astute Class). This Programme of Studies Led to the Issue of an Invitation to Tender for the Design and Build of an Initial Batch of Three Astute Class SSNs and a Further Approval of £2m (1992/1993 Prices) for Contractor and Defence Research Agency Support to MOD During the Tendering Exercise in 1994.

In July 1994, as a Result of Concerns over the Overall Affordability of the Programme, Minister (Defence Procurement) and the Treasury Approved a Further £23.5m (at 1993/1994 Prices) for Risk Reduction Studies to be Undertaken in Parallel with the Formal Bid Phase of the Project. to Maintain an Effective Competition, Contracts for Risk Reduction Were Awarded to both Bidders, GEC Marconi and Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd. the Successful Outcome of These Studies Led to Equipment Approvals Committee Approval (the Equivalent of Main Gate) in March 1997 to Place a Contract for the Design, Build and Initial Support of Three Astute Class Submarines with GEC Marconi, Now BAE Systems.
