# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events

In January 2003 the United States Javelin system produced by the Raytheon/Lockheed Martin Joint Venture was selected to meet the Light Forces Anti-Tank Guided Weapon (LFATGW) requirement for the manufacture, supply and support of a crew portable Medium Range Anti-Tank Guided Weapon for the Light Forces, including training equipment. This is a Military Off the Shelf (MOTS) procurement.

Javelin is man-portable by a crew of two, carrying two missiles, for up to 16 kilometres. In order to meet the LFATGW requirement, the system is being provided to the Light Forces and Mechanised Infantry, replacing the ageing MILAN system. The Command Launch Unit (CLU) is reusable and offers a surveillance capability and the missile is effective against all ground vehicles including modern and future battle tanks. Javelin has a secondary capability against fixed defences and the ability to allow enclosed space firing. Effective range is out to 2.5 kilometres.

To minimise live firings in training the emphasis is being placed on simulation. The system entered service with the Light Forces in July 2005, four months ahead of the planned In-Service Date.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The Assessment Phase evaluated available Military Off The Shelf systems, established through competition the best value for money solution to meet the requirement and produced a recommended option.

Initial Gate Approval was secured in July 2000 and in July 2001 a Review Note was approved to incorporate the Mechanised Infantry requirement. Following the issue of a Request for Proposals in September 2000, a contract was placed with Rafael to enable evaluation of the SPIKE system, and two Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Cases were implemented with the United States Department of Defense to acquire the JAVELIN system and to obtain the services of the Javelin Joint Venture. These were the only weapons systems deemed likely to meet the requirements in the necessary timescale.

The Main Gate approval in January 2003 authorised the procurement of the JAVELIN system. A contract was placed with the JAVELIN Joint Venture (Raytheon and Lockheed Martin) in February 2003, supported by an FMS Case, for Demonstration, Manufacture and Support.
