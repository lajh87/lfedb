# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal is a Communication Project that will Provide Highly Protected, High Data Rate Satellite Communication Capability to Selected Submarines and Command Capable Platforms. It will Deliver Capacity to Covertly Exchange Large Volumes of Information with Co-Operating Forces and Command, Survival Against Jamming, Low Vulnerability to Geo-Location and Direct Interoperability with UK, US and Allied Forces.

Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal is an International Collaborative Programme Based on the US Advanced Extremely High Frequency Programme, under which the UK along with Canada and the Netherlands Have Signed a Memorandum of Understanding for Utilisation of an Agreed Share of the Capacity of a New Constellation of Advanced Extremely High Frequency Satellites Due to Enter Service from 2010 Onwards. Terminals, Submarine Masts, and Antennas for Ships and Shore Stations to Meet the UK Requirements Have Been Ordered under US Foreign Military Sales Arrangements. Manufacture of Submarine Masts is Complete and the Remaining Foreign Military Sales Articles are on Contract with Raytheon Company. in View of the Key Dependence on US Acquisition Projects, There is No Overall Prime Contractor and MoD is Performing the Role of the Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal System Design Authority with Technical Support Provided by Qinetiq. Installation of Naval Extremely High

Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal Equipment and Integration with Existing and Planned Information Infrastructure Has Been Contracted for with the Relevant Providers via the Associated Platform or Project Integrated Project Teams.

Slippage to the US Advanced Extremely High Frequency Satellite Programme Has Made it Impossible to Achieve the UK Advanced Extremely High Frequency ISD as Endorsed in the Main Gate Business Case. as a Consequence, the Strategy for Deployment of Terminal Types Across Platforms Has Been Reviewed with Emphasis on the Need to Ensure Astute Submarines Have a Satellite Communication Capability on Build. US Department of Defence Have Given Approval for Early Release of Modified Super High Frequency Follow on Terminals, that will be Fitted in Astute Class Submarines and Deliver a Capability to Meet some of the System Requirements over UK Skynet 4&5 Satellites by September 2009 (ISD). the Advanced Extremely High Frequency in Service Date is Dependent Upon the Deployment of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency Satellite Constellation and the Delivery of Navy Multiband Terminals for UK Submarines, Carriers and Satellite Ground Stations; Forecast is May 2012. There is a Need to Submit a Review Note to the Approving Authorities in Order to Gain Approval of the Revised Forecasts of Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communications Terminal ISD and Costs.

## 3e. Operational Impact of ISD Variation

The Late Arrival of Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite

Communication Terminal will Result in a Delay in Providing Ships Submersible Nuclear the Ability to Integrate with Network-Based Operations and the Distributed Collaborative Planning and Shared Situational Awareness for which Network Enabled Capability is the Enabler (Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal is Viewed as the Only Viable Bearer for Delivery of Defence Information Infrastructure Enterprise Services (Joint Command & Control Support Programme Etc) to Submarines, and so is Pivotal for the more Effective Integration of Ship Submersible Nuclears in Joint and Coalition Operations). the Interim Nature of Enhanced Ship Submersible Nuclear Information eXchange is Important as Concerns Exist over the Continued Use of International Maritime Satellite

Communication. Specifically, International Maritime Satellite Communication Does not Deliver Assured Communications, There are Clear Conflicts over Its Use for Offensive Strike and the International Maritime Satellite Communication Charter, and Elements of the Architecture are Grounded in China. Enhanced Ship Submersible Nuclear Information eXchange Provides a Lower Data Rate when Compared with Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal.

There will be Limited Capability on Those Enhanced Ship Submersible Nuclear Information eXchange Fitted Vessels. Without Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal, There is an Increase in Vulnerability Through Geo-Location and Near-Surface Presence, Reducing Submarines’ Ability to Contribute to Military Tasks 1.1 (Strategic Intelligence) & 1.2 (Nuclear Deterrence).

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

In March 2001, MoD Considered an Initial Gate Business Case for Naval Extremely High

Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal and Approved an

Assessment Phase Designed to Establish the Most Cost-Effective Solution for Meeting Submarine Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal Requirements, Command Ships Operational Control Requirements and the Associated Shore Infrastructure.

A Number of Options Were Investigated Including the Provision of Commercial Satellite

Communication, Super High Frequency Only, Extremely High Frequency Only and Dual Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency. the Operational Benefits and Value for Money Were Reported in the Main Gate Business Case which Recommended that Extremely High Frequency Was the Only Solution that can Provide Non-Geolocatable, High Capacity Communications that Enable the Submarine to Remain Covert. It also Identified that Super High Frequency can Provide Nationally Assured High Capacity Information Exchange with UK but Suffers Weaknesses in Highly Stressed Environments. the Recommendation Was Accepted for a Dual Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Capability.

Although the UK Was Procuring Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Within SKYNET5, Assessment Phase Studies Concluded that the UK Service Provision Model Would not be Cost Effective for an Extremely High Frequency Capability and the SKYNET 5 PFI Contractor Would not Provide an Extremely High Frequency Space Segment. a Memorandum of Understanding Was Negotiated to Achieve Participation in the US Advanced Extremely High Frequency Programme to Secure Sufficient Capacity to Support Ship Submersible Nuclear Operations. for Similar Reasons of Value for Money, it Was Agreed that Terminal Equipment and Submarine Satellite Communication Masts Would be Procured under Foreign Military Sales Procedures, Thus Allowing the MoD to Benefit from Quantity Discounts by Joining Large US Navy Production Orders, Harmonise UK and US Ship Submersible Nuclear Satellite Communication Programmes and Minimise Non-Recurring Expenditure.

The Main Gate Business Case also Recognised that Given the Dependencies on US Programmes, a Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal Prime Contractor Would Have No Control over the Various Platform Primes and MoD Would be Unable to Pass on System Design and Interface Risks. Accordingly, the Approved Strategy Was that the Naval Extremely High Frequency/Super High Frequency Satellite Communication Terminal Project Retains System Design Authority and Contract Technical Support for Specific Tasks on a Firm Price Basis.
