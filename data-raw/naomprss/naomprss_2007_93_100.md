Integrated Project Team Responsible:

INFANTRY GUIDED WEAPONS

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability: Director Equipment Capability (Ground Manoeuvre)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Next Generation Light Anti-Armour Weapon (NLAW) is a Man-Portable Short-Range Anti-Armour Weapon to be Carried and Used by all Arms and Services and Replaces the LAW 80 Capability. NLAW will Provide a Predictive Line-of Sight Capability Out to a Range of 600m, Against Main Battle Tanks and Light Armoured Vehicles, when both Stationary and Manoeuvring, and Have the Ability to be Fired from Enclosed Spaces and Defensive Positions. It will Have a Secondary Role as a Means of Attacking Structures. the Project is an Enhanced Off-the-Shelf Procurement, and Includes the Provision of Training Systems and Support. the Weapon System is Being Developed in Conjunction with the Swedish Defence Material Administration. the NLAW Prime Contractor is SAAB Bofors Dynamics of Sweden, with Thales Air Defence Ltd as the Main UK Sub-Contractor.

NLAW will be Used by all Forces Operating in the Land Environment.

Completion of the Final Design of the NLAW System, and Subsequent Production, Has Been Delayed as a Result of System Qualification Difficulties. Entry of the System into Service Has Been Deferred until at Least July 2008.

## 3e. Operational Impact of ISD Variation

NLAW will Provide the Short Range Anti-Armour Capability for all Forces Operating in the Land Environment as a Replacement for LAW 80. the Interim Light Anti-Armour Weapon (ILAW) Was Procured under an Urgent Operational Requirement to Meet the Capability Gap Created by the Early Withdrawal of LAW 80. the Procurement Was Scaled for Current Operations Only and Presently Has a Planned Out of Service Date of May-2009. NLAW is Being Procured for General Use (for all Arms and Services), Unlike ILAW which Was Procured in Limited Numbers for Operations and Provides a less Effective Capability than that which NLAW will Deliver.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The NLAW Project Predates SMART Approvals and as Such There Was No Initial Gate or Assessment

Phase. Following Approval to Issue an Invitation to Tender to Conduct Project Definition Studies in September 1997, and Subsequent Approval for the Project Definition Phase in July 1999, Competitive Firm Price Contracts Were Awarded in October 1999 to Matra BAe Dynamics in the UK and Celsius in Sweden. the Delay Between Approval to Issue the Invitation to Tender and Contract Award Was Caused by Uncertainty over the Future of the Medium Range TRIGAT Anti-Armour Programme, and Resulted in Slippage to the Forecast ISD. the Project Definition Phase Contracts Lasted Up to 22 Months and Bids for the Demonstration, Manufacture and Support Phases Were Received in January 2001. the Contractors Were Required to Confirm the Performance of their Baseline System, Developing Weapon Enhancements and Prototype Training Systems Needed to Meet NLAW Requirements.

Risk Reduction and Trade-Off Studies Were Undertaken and Detailed Management, Milestone and Trials Plans Produced. the Opportunities for Collaboration with Other Countries Were Explored and an MOU with Sweden, Facilitating Joint Development, Was Signed in June 2002.

Main Gate Approval to Proceed to the Demonstration, Manufacture and Support Phases, Together with Downselection to Saab Bofors Dynamics (Formerly Part of Celsius), Was Achieved in May 2002.

Contract Placement Followed in June 2002.
