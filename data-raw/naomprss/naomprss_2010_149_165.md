• Post Main Investment Decision – Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance &
Attack Mk4

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4 will Replace the Current Nimrod Maritime

Reconnaissance Mk2 as the New Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4 will Provide Significantly Enhanced Anti-Submarine and Anti-Surface Warfare Capability Through Improved Aircraft and Sensor Performance, a Greater Degree of System Integration, Better Human Machine Interface Design and a Substantial Improvement in Availability and Supportability.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

In November 1992, the Equipment Approvals Committee Approved a Request for Information Exercise Whereby 17 Companies Were Invited to Provide Responses to the Draft Replacement Maritime Patrol Aircraft Staff Requirement. Following Analysis of the Industry Responses, the Equipment Approvals Committee Endorsed the Requirement and Approved an Invitation to Tender Phase Whereby Four Companies (BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Loral and Dassault) Were Invited to Provide Detailed Technical and Commercial Proposals for an Aircraft to Meet the Endorsed Staff Requirement. Dassault Withdrew from the Competition in January 1996, and Whilst Lockheed Martin and Loral Merged in May 1996, They Maintained the Two Separate Proposals until the Competition Concluded. Following Assessment of These Responses, Selection of BAE Systems’ Nimrod 2000 (Later to be Re-Designated Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4) Offer Was Approved by Equipment Approvals Committee and Ministers in July 1996. This Was the Equivalent of Main Gate Approval.

## A.3. Progress

The Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4 Contract for the Design, Development and Production of 21 Aircraft Was Placed with BAE Systems in 1996, Following an International Competition. the Contract Was Re-Negotiated in Mid 1999 and Again in Early 2002 – when the Department Reduced the Number of Aircraft from 21 to 18. Continued Technical and Resource Problems Led to a Further Review of the Programme and in February 2003 the Department Reached an Agreement with BAE Systems to Change the Fixed Price Contract to a Target Cost Incentive Fee Contract for Design and Development, which Included Manufacture of Three Trials Aircraft, and an Option for a Further Fifteen Production Aircraft. Pending Definition of a Satisfactory Design Standard, Series Production Activities Were Limited to Those Activities Vital to the Preservation of the Essential Skill Sets Within BAE Systems and Its Supply Chain. Flight Trials Commenced in August 2004.

In July 2004, Studies Determined that the Capability of the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4 Would Enable the Maritime Reconnaissance Requirement to be Met with a Fleet of About 12 Aircraft and the Number to be Procured Has Been Reduced Accordingly. a Further Review of the Programme Identified Increased Production Costs and that the in Service Date for the Capability Would Need to be Delayed in Order to Make the Programme Affordable Within Departmental Funding Constraints. a Business Case Seeking Authorisation of Commitment to Full Production Was Approved in May 2006, and the Contract Was Amended to Re-Introduce the Production Requirements in July 2006. as Part of the Approval Process the Project’s Original Key Requirements Were Redefined and Endorsed as Key Performance Measures by the Investment Approval Board and a Revised Definition of the in

Service Date Was Approved. Affordability Issues Identified in Spring 2008 Resulted in a Further Reduction in the Number of Aircraft from 12 to 9. in December 2009 Secretary of State for Defence Announced that the Introduction of the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4 Would be Delayed as One of a Range of Measures Aimed at Reprioritising Defence Expenditure to Focus on Current Operations. Consequently the in Service Date Has Been Delayed by 22 Months to October 2012.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Loss of the Capability Offered by the Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4 Would Have an Adverse Effect on the Protection of the Strategic Nuclear Deterrent, the Provision of which is One of the Ministry of Defence’s Standing Strategic Tasks. in Addition, the Maintenance of the Integrity of the UK Through Detection of Hostile Air and Sea Craft Would be Compromised.

## A.7. Support Strategy

The Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4 Support Strategy is Currently in the Assessment Phase and the Proposed Solution is Being Revised to Address the Impact of the Financial Planning Round 2010 Measure which Removed £110m of Funding from the Project in Order to Reprioritise Defence Expenditure. a Series of Contracts Were Placed with BAE Systems to Fund the Development of the Support Solution and to Maintain Continuity in the Build Up of Support Services Prior to the Aircraft Beginning Flying Training with the RAF from Mid 2010.

3.1 Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4

Nimrod Maritime Reconnaissance and Attack Mk4 is a Legacy Project and Its Original Approval Did not Include Key Performance Measures. Key Performance Measures Have Since Been Retrospectively Developed from First Principles to Comply with Latest Smart Acquisition Guidelines;
They Were Endorsed by the Investment Approval Board in June 2006.
