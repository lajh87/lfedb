# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Typhoon, Formerly Known as Eurofighter, is an Agile Multi-Role Combat Aircraft. Originally Designed Primarily, but not Exclusively, for Air Superiority the Aircraft will also be Capable of Delivering a Precision Ground Attack Capability. Typhoon will Have the Flexibility to Respond to the Uncertain Demands of the Current Strategic Environment and will Enable the Royal Air Force to Replace Progressively the Tornado F3 and Jaguar Aircraft.

The Aircraft is Being Developed in a Collaborative Project with Germany, Italy and Spain, and is Managed on Behalf of the Four Nations by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA). the Contract for the First Tranche of 148 Aircraft, of which 55 Valued at some £2.5bn are for the UK, Was Signed in September 1998. the Second Tranche Comprising 236 Aircraft, 89 of which are for the UK, Was Placed on Contract in December 2004. a Decision on the Third Tranche of 232 Aircraft (88 for the UK) is not Required Before 2008. the Estimated Current Cost of Typhoon Was Classified in MPR05 and Remains so in MPR07, in Order to Protect the UK’s Ability to Negotiate for any Subsequent Purchase of the Aircraft.

Typhoon Has Now Been in Service with the RAF for Nearly Four Years and Completed over 7,000 Flying Hours. the First Operational Squadron, No.3 (Fighter) Squadron, Formed on 31 March 2006, are Currently Spearheading the Work to Take over Quick Reaction Alert Duties from the Tornado F3 Force in Summer 2007. the Formation of a Second Operational Squadron, 11(F) Squadron, Took Place in March 2007.

A Contract Was Secured in July 2006 to Deliver an Austere Precision Air-to-Surface Capability on RAF Typhoon, Providing the Ability to Mount all Weather Autonomous Precision Ground Attack Missions. This will be Provided in Advance of a more Comprehensive Air-to-Surface Package which is Contained Within the Typhoon Future Capabilities Programme (FCP), which Has Been the Subject of a Separate Approval by the UK MoD Approving Authorities and Achieved Final Contract Signature in March 2007.

Potential Export Customers Have Been Identified and the Department (in Conjunction with the Typhoon Partner Nations and Industry) is Supporting a Number of Export Campaigns. the First Export Customer, Austria, Signed a Procurement Contract in July 2003 for Deliveries to Begin in 2007, and a Memorandum of Understanding Was Signed in December 2006 by the Four Nations and Austria for the Association of Austria with the Typhoon Programme.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Pre-Development, which Commenced with the Approval of the Feasibility Study in 1984, Comprised a Number of Activities. Following Early Concept Studies, and Various Efforts at Establishing a Collaborative Programme, There Were Two Key Typhoon Demonstration Activities Completed by the UK Before Development: The Experimental Aircraft Programme (EAP), an Airframe Programme Primarily Aimed at Proving the Feasibility of the Typhoon Unstable Flight Control Concepts, and the XG40 Engine Demonstrator Programme at Rolls Royce. the Results of These Demonstrators and their Associated Studies, Together with the Results of Similar Work Within the Other Nations Were Harmonised in a Definition, Refinement and Risk Reduction Phase that Ran from the End of 1985 when Four Nations Signed the Initial Memorandum of Understanding, until 1988 when the Development Contract Was Signed.
