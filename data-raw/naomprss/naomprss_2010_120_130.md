# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

Following the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, UK Participation in the Concept Demonstration Phase of the Programme and Significant Analysis, the US Joint Strike Fighter Was Selected to Meet the Joint Combat Aircraft Requirement for Carrier Strike. a Tailored Main Gate Demonstration Approval Was Obtained in January 2001 for Participation in the System Development and Demonstration Phase to the Value of
£1,300m, along with £600m for Related Non-System Development and Demonstration Work, Leading to Signature that Month by UK and United States Governments of the System Development and Demonstration Memorandum of Understanding. the Selection of Lockheed Martin as the Joint Strike Fighter Air System Prime Contractor Included a Teaming Agreement with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to Collectively Form Team Joint Strike Fighter. Two Separate and Competitive Propulsion Contracts Were Awarded to Pratt and Whitney for the F135 Engine and General Electric/Rolls Royce Fighter Engine Team for the F136 Engine. Whilst Other Partners Joined the Programme at Level 2 and 3 Entry Arrangements, Only United States and UK Requirements Have Driven the System Development and Demonstration Baseline Solution.

In September 2002 the UK Selected the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Joint Strike Fighter Variant to Meet the Requirement. a Review of the Joint Strike Fighter Programme and the Viability of the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Design Was Completed in January 2005. It Concluded that a Successful Programme of Weight Reduction Initiatives and Other Performance Enhancements Had Restored Confidence that the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Design Should Remain the UK’s Planning Assumption. a Further Review by the Investment Approvals Board in July 2006 Confirmed this Decision.

On 12 December 2006 Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support Signed the Production

Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding , which Was the First of Four Main Gates Planned for the Introduction to Service of Joint Combat Aircraft. in March 2009, Approval Was Given for Phase 2 of the Joint Combat Aircraft Incremental Strategy, for Participation in Joint Initial Operational Test & Evaluation with the United States Services. This will Allow the UK to Fully Understand and Influence the Joint Strike Fighter Programme as it Moves into a New Phase.

Two Key User Requirements Remain at Risk:

KUR04 - Mission Performance: In July 2006 the Investment Approvals Board Directed that Shipborne Rolling and Vertical Landing Should be Included in Future Development of the Joint Combat Aircraft Design to Mitigate the Risk to the Vertical Land Bring Back Capability. Ship-Borne Rolling Vertical Landing is Now Being Taken Forward Within the Joint Strike Fighter Programme under UK Leadership.

KUR03 – Range; Based on Modelling and Simulation Results, the Range Capability for Joint Strike Fighter Short Take Off and Vertical Landing is Approaching the Specified Target Set for UK Requirements Based on UK Operating Scenarios. However, this Potential Shortfall is Based Primarily on Modelling with Very Limited Experience in Actual Flight Test. Further Flight Testing is Planned to Gain an Accurate Assessment of this Potential Problem and Mitigation Actions will be Developed Accordingly.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Approval Was Obtained in November 1996 to Enter the Concept Demonstration Phase on the Joint Strike Fighter Programme under a Memorandum of Understanding Signed in December 1995. the Phase Began in November 1996 with Two Competing United States Prime Contractors (Boeing and Lockheed Martin) Designing and Flying Demonstration Aircraft on which the Selection of the Preferred Bidder Was Based. a Tailored Main Gate Demonstration Approval Was Obtained in January 2001 for Participation in the System Development and Demonstration Phase. the Phase Completed in October 2001 with the Announcement of Lockheed Martin as the Successful Bidder. Studies into Alternative Options to Joint Strike Fighter to Meet the Requirement Were also Conducted but Were Rejected on Cost Effective Grounds. the Options Were US F/A18E Aircraft, French Rafale M, a “navalised” Eurofighter Typhoon and an Advanced Harrier.

## A.3. Progress

On 18 March 2009, the UK Secretary of State for Defence Announced the Approval to Purchase Three

Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Variants of Joint Strike Fighters for Operational Test and Evaluation. the UK Placed Requirements on the US Department of Defense for the Procurement of These Aircraft with Associated Support and Training Equipment, and the First Two Aircraft are Already on the Production Line at Lockheed’s Factory in Fort Worth, Texas. on the 26 January 2010, Sqn Ldr Steve Long Became the First UK Military Pilot to Fly the Aircraft when He Conducted a Test Flight at Patuxant River in Maryland, USA. on 18 March 2010 the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Variant Demonstrated Significant Progress in Fully Meeting Capability by Successfully Completing Its First Vertical Landing at US Naval Air Field Patuxant River. as a Result of a Recent Senior Department of Defense Review of the Programme Several Key Changes Have Been Implemented Including a Delay to the Completion of the System, Development and Demonstration Phase by One Year to November 2014. as the UK Has a Fixed Contribution to the System Development and Demonstration Phase the UK is Protected from any Cost Increases that this Delay Has Generated. However it is Currently Unclear How the Programme Review will Impact Jet Production Costs Although the Main Impact is Expected to be Outside of the Current Commitment to Operational Test & Evaluation. for MPR10 the Latest US Department of Defense Estimates Have Been Used to Determine Production Forecast Against Approval. the Joint Combat Aircraft Project Team are Currently Working to a Planning Assumption that Up to 150 Jets will be Procured. However both this Number and the Formal Setting of an in Service Date are Subject to the Strategic Defence and Security Review.

## A.4. Capability Risks

This Capability Provides the UK with a Fifth Generation Expeditionary Air to Ground, Air to Air and

Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Capability to Satisfy the 1998 Strategic Defence Review Requirement for a Carrier Capable Joint Combat Aircraft. Without this Capability the UK will be Unable to Meet Its Combat Air and Carrier Strike Requirements and be Unable to Support Ground Forces in Multi Threat Environments at a Time and Place of the Government’s Choosing.
