FUTURE STRATEGIC TANKER AIRCRAFT

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Service will Provide the Air-to-Air Refuelling and the Passenger Air

Transport Capabilities which Currently are Provided by the Royal Air Force’s Fleet of VC10 and TriStar Aircraft. Air-to-Air Refuelling is a Key Military Capability that Significantly Increases the Operational Range and Endurance of Front Line Aircraft Across a Range of Defence Roles and Military Tasks.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase

Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Was Nominated as a Potential Private Finance Initiative Project in 1997. an Assessment Phase, Designed to Confirm Whether PFI Would Offer Best Value for Money, Was Launched Following Initial Gate Approval in December 2000.

The Assessment Phase Confirmed Industry’s Ability to Meet the Service Requirement, Programme Timescales and Costs and Determined that the Inclusion of Passenger Air Transport Capability in the Contract Would Represent Value for Money. It also Clarified the Manning and Personnel Implications.

## A.3. Progress

The Main Gate Business Case Was Submitted to the Investment Approvals Board in January 2007 and Was Approved in May 2007. in March 2008 a 27 Year PFI Contract Was Signed.

The Final Approval Envelope for Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Was Set by the Investment Approval Board in June 2008.

The Investment Approvals Board Approved Contract not to Exceed Cost Remains at £10.5bn. in Addition There will be Front Line Command Manpower and Support Costs Leading to a Total Cost of £12.3bn.

The First Set of Wings Was Rolled Out on Time in February 2009 at Broughton. These Were Transferred to the Airbus Site in Toulouse. the Successful Maiden Flight of the First Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft A330-200 Aircraft Took Place on the 4th June 2009; the Aircraft Was Subsequently Delivered to the Airbus Military Purposebuilt Hangar Facility Getafé in Spain on the 10th July 2009. It Was Joined by the Second Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft on the 7th September 2009;
both Aircraft Have Now Been Converted for their Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Role, which Includes Fitting of Military Avionics as Well as the Specialist Refuelling Equipment.

Following this Work both Aircraft Have Moved into the Certification and Qualification Programme.

A Significant Amount of the Aircraft Development Risk Has Now Diminished with the Issue of the Final Technical Certification (i.e. a Military Certification) for the Royal Australian Air Force A330 Multi Role Tanker Aircraft (MRTT).

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is not Simply About the Procurement of Aircraft, but Covers all Aspects of an Integrated Worldwide Aircraft Service, Ranging from the Provision of the Infrastructure - Including a Hangar Complex (which Allows for the Maintenance of Two Aircraft Simultaneously; Houses the Two Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Squadrons; the Maintenance Crew; Operations Centre and Associated Office Accommodation) - a Full Flight Crew and Engineer Training Service, Despatch and Ground Support. This New Facility will be the Main AirTanker Hub for the Provision of the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Service at RAF Brize Norton in Readiness for the Delivery of the First Aircraft in 2011. AirTanker Held an Official Opening on 31 March 2011.

The Construction of the Training Facility Building Has Been Completed Ahead of Schedule and the Fit-Out is Progressing Well with the Primary Activity Being the Installation of the Wiring and Equipment, Furnishings, and Decoration.

The AirTanker Services Elements of the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Programme Continue to be Delivered to Schedule and Remain on Course to Satisfy their Obligations for Planned Introduction to Service Including the Achievement of their Operating Licences.

In 2011 Funding Was Made Available to Provide Enhanced Protection of Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft; AirTanker are Currently Progressing with a Technical Feasibility Study for this Enhancement.

Project Summary Sheet

FUTURE STRATEGIC TANKER AIRCRAFT

## A.4. Capability Risks

The First VC10 Aircraft Entered Service in the 1960s and These Were Converted to Air-to-Air Refuelling Tankers at Various Dates Between 1980 and 1996. the Aircraft Has Ageing and Outdated Technology, and the Risks to Maintaining Reliability and Value for Money Have Grown and Ultimately it will not be Possible to Sustain Capability. the TriStars First Entered Airline Service in the Early 1970s and Converted to their Current Tanker and Tanker/Freight Roles Between 1983 and 1987. These Aircraft are Planned to Go Out of Service in 2013.

The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft is Planned to Replace the Air-to-Air Refuelling Capability and Passenger Air Transport Capability Provided by the RAFs VC10 and TriStar Fleets. the Aircraft will be on the Military Register from the First Day in the Role.

Without Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft, a Significant Gap Would Appear in the UK’s Strategic Deployment and Tactical Strike Capabilities. the Primary Role for the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft will be Air-to-Air Refuelling and the Objective of These Operations is to Enhance the Combat Effectiveness by Extending the Range, Payload or Endurance of Receiver Aircraft where and when it is Most Needed. Strategic Air Refuelling Supports the Deployment of Forces to Theatre Whilst Tactical or Theatre Air Refuelling Provides Mission Support to Units Active in an Operational Theatre.
