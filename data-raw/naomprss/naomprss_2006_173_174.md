<th>mars will Investigate a Wide Range of Solutions to Provide the Logistic Support Requirements of the Future Royal Navy and Sea-Based Support to Deployed Forces. MARS Vessels will Play a Significant Part in Providing Sea-Based Support to Amphibious, Land and Air Forces in the Littoral where Host Nation Support is Absent or Limited. as the MARS Vessels Come into Service, They will Replace the Current Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Vessels as They are Gradually Withdrawn from Service. MARS Vessels will Provide Three Capabilities:

x Bulk Consumables – the Provision of Fuel, Oils, Lubricants, Ammunition, Food, Water and Air Stores to Embarked Forces. x Joint Sea Based Logistics - The Provision of Logistic Support from Afloat to Joint Forces Ashore. x Forward Aviation Support - The Provision of Support to Maritime Rotary-Wing Operations and Support to Amphibious Rotorcraft Operations, as Well as the Provision of Operational Maintenance Support for Deployed Helicopters.

MARS Plans to Deliver First Up to Five Dedicated Tankers Followed by a Number of Other Vessels. the Actual Number and Type of Vessels Required will be Determined During the Assessment Phase. These Ships will be Double Hulled to Comply with Environmental Requirements.</Th>

# SECTION 2: THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

Note: Actual in Service Dates and Costs are not Set until Projects Reach the Point in Time when the Main Investment Decision is Made Ie Main Gate Approval. Until this Point all Costs and Dates are Outline Assumptions Solely for Internal Planning Purposes.

## 2a. Description of the Assessment Phase

The MARS Project Received Formal Approval to Enter Its Assessment Phase in July 2005.

The Preferred Contractual Route for Meeting the MARS Requirement is to Create a Form of Alliance (or Delivery Team) with a Lead Contractor (the Integrator). the Contract will be Developed with Industry to Include Continuous Communications and Engagement, to Identify and Apportion Appropriate Ownership of Risk, and Allow Visibility and Access to the Entire Supply Chain and Shares in Cost Savings.

The MARS Assessment Phase will Cover Generic Assessment and Design Activity for the Whole Programme and the Initial Design for the First Class of Ships. Additionally, the Assessment Phase will be Used to Select the Alliance Team or Teams for the MARS Programme.

The MARS Ships are Expected to be Procured in Distinct Phases, with Class 1 and Each Subsequent Class Being Approved by Separate Submissions to the Department’s Investment Approvals Board.

It is Intended that the Design of Class 1 will be Developed to a High Enough Level to Enable Manufacture to Start as Soon as the Main Investment Decision is Made. Due to the Planned Phased Nature of the Project, Further Design on Subsequent Classes will Take Place after the Main Investment Decision, and an Early Estimate for this is
\\\. This Brings the Total Expected Cost of Assessment Work and Later Design for Future Classes To\\\, Subject to more Detailed Investigations into the Nature of Future Classes and the Level of Design to be Undertaken. the Procurement Approach and Contractual Arrangements are all Derisked Pre Main Gate.
