# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

Following UK Participation in the Concept Demonstration Phase of the Programme, the US

Joint Strike Fighter Was Selected to Meet the Joint Combat Aircraft Requirement. the Strategic

Defence Review Confirmed this Requirement to Provide the Joint Force 2000 (Joint Command for Harrier Forces) with a Multi-Role Fighter/Attack Aircraft to Replace the Royal Navy Sea Harrier and the Royal Air Force Harrier GR7/9. a Tailored Main Gate Demonstration Approval Was Obtained in January 2001 for Participation in the System Development and Demonstration Phase to the Value of £1.3bn, along with
£600m for Related Non-System Development and

Demonstration Work, Leading to Signature that Month by UK and US Governments of the System

Development and Demonstration Memorandum of Understanding. the Selection of Lockheed

Martin as the Joint Strike Fighter Air System Prime Contractor Included a Teaming Agreement with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems to Collectively Form Team Joint Strike Fighter. Two Separate and Competitive Propulsion Contracts Were Awarded to Pratt and Witney for the F135 Engine and GE/Rolls Royce Fighter Engine Team for the F136 Engine. Whilst Other Partners Joined the Programme at Level 2 and 3 Entry Arrangements, Only US and UK Requirements Drive the System Development and Demonstration Baseline Solution.

In September 2002 the UK Selected the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Joint Strike Fighter Variant to Meet Our Requirement. a Review of the Joint Strike Fighter Programme and the Viability of the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Design Was Completed in January 2005 and Concluded that a Successful Programme of Weight Reduction Initiatives and Other Performance Enhancements Had Restored Confidence that the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Design Should Remain the UK’s Planning Assumption. a Further Review by the Investment Approvals Board in July 2006 Confirmed this Decision.

On 12 December 2006 Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support Signed the Production Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding, Reporting of this Phase will Commence in MPR09 when the UK Plan to Purchase the First Aircraft, Allowing the UK to Continue to Influence all Aspects of the Joint Strike Fighter Programme as it Moves into a New Phase.

The Flight Test Programme Commenced on 15 December 2006 with the Successful First Flight of the First Conventional Take-Off and Land Aircraft. the First Short Take Off and Vertical Landing Aircraft is Currently Planned to Fly in Summer 2008. Continued Participation in the Joint Strike Fighter Programme will Deliver a Block 3 Aircraft with Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground Capabilities to the UK.

Two Key User Requirements Remain at Risk:

KUR04 - Mission Performance: In July 2006 the Investment Approvals Board Directed that Ship-Borne Rolling and Vertical Landing Should be Included in Future Development of the Joint Combat Aircraft Design to Mitigate the Risk to the Vertical Land Bring Back Capability.

KUR06 – Logistic Footprint: Performance Remains Marginally Better than Requirement, Although Due to Very Narrow Margin this KUR Remains at Risk. Work is Ongoing with Lockheed Martin to Drive Down Logistic Footprint to Ensure it Remains Within Specification as the Air System Matures Throughout the System Development and Demonstration Phase.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Approval Was Obtained in November 1996 to Enter the Concept Demonstration Phase on the

Joint Strike Fighter Programme under a Memorandum of Understanding Signed in December 1995. the Phase Began in November 1996 with Two Competing US Prime Contractors (Boeing and Lockheed Martin) Designing Weapons Systems and Flying Demonstration Aircraft on which the Selection of the Preferred Bidder Was Based. the Phase Completed in October 2001 with the Announcement of Lockheed Martin as the Successful Bidder. Studies into Alternative Options to Joint Strike Fighter to Meet the Requirement Were also Conducted but Were Rejected on Cost Effective Grounds. the Options Were US F/A18E Aircraft, French Rafale M, a “navalised” Eurofighter and an Advanced Harrier.

## 5b. Cost of the Assessment Phase

| £m (Outturn Prices)       | Assessment Phase Cost | Proportion of Total Estimated Procurement Expenditure |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Actual Cost                   | 144                       | 7.3%                                                      |
| Approved Cost at Initial Gate | 150                       | 7.6%                                                      |

[^1]: In Order to Match the US Procurement Cycle the JCA Main Gate Was Tailored for Development Only. Unit Production Cost Approval will be Sought as Part of MG UK Production Approval.

[^2]: The in Service Date (ISD) Approval will be Sought as Part of the Incremental Production Approval Strategy.

[^3]: Three Point Estimates for the Production Phase Have yet to be Determined, as Costs are Dependant on the Final Aircraft Numbers.

† for Main Gate Development Approval, ISD Was Noted, not Approved.
