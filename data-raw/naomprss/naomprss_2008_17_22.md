Integrated Project Team Responsible:

UNITED KINGDOM MILITARY FLYING TRAINING SYSTEM (UKMFTS)

Single Point of Accountability for Project Capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Theatre Airspace)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PROJECT

## 1a. Project Description, Progress and Key Future Events

The MoD Requires an Advanced Jet Trainer for Pre-Operational Training of Fast-Jet Pilots. This Task is Currently Fulfilled by the Hawk TMk1 Aircraft, which will Need to be Replaced in the Tactical Weapons Training Role from 2010 Onwards. the Full Range of Skills Required for Aircrew to Fly Front-Line Aircraft Cannot Now be Gained using the Current Advanced Jet Trainer, so more Training on Operational Aircraft Has to be Undertaken. the Introduction of Typhoon and the Future Joint Combat Aircraft Exacerbates this Training Gap Such that the Required Standard for Typhoon Aircrew is not Achievable with Hawk TMk1.

The Advanced Jet Trainer is the Fast Jet Element of the Wider UK Military Flying Training System Programme and will Deliver Capabilities Including: a Modern Glass Cockpit Environment, an Avionics Suite Compliant with Latest Airspace Legislation, an Embedded Training System that Simulates Front-Line Sensors and Weapons and a Flexible and Upgradeable Mission System. Support, Infrastructure and a Ground Based Training Environment will also be Provided. Advanced Jet Trainer is Contracted for in Such a Way to Ensure that it can be Subsumed Within the Main UK Military Flying Training System Contract at a Later Date.

The Development and Production Programmes Remain on Track to Deliver on Time. the Production Aircraft Build Standard Was Fixed at Main Gate. a Capability Enhancement Has Had Business Case Approval. Contract Negotiations are Underway for Provision of Aircraft Support Post Delivery.

# SECTION 5: HISTORY UP TO MAIN GATE APPROVAL

## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase

At Initial Gate (December 2002) Advanced Jet Trainer Was a Component of United Kingdom

Military Flying Training System. Within the £39m Approved for United Kingdom Military Flying Training System Assessment, £2m Related to Advanced Jet Trainer and a PFI Approach Was Assumed. in July 2003 a Ministerial Direction Was Given to Conventionally Procure Hawk 128 from BAE Systems.

In 2003 a £31m Risk Reduction Contract Was Placed with BAES to Cover Risk Reduction Activities to October 2003. BAE Systems Continued to Work at Risk on Assessment Phase Activities Up to November 2004 when Approval Was Given for a Combined Assessment & Development Phase Based on an Incremental Approach at a not to Exceed Price of £196m and a not to Exceed Completion Date of August 2008; the Assessment Phase Element of this Approval Was Around £75m. a Design and Development Contract Was Let to BAE Systems in December 2004.

Main Gate Approval Was Achieved in August 2006 for a not to Exceed Figure of £497m at 80% Confidence, Compared to Initial Gate Approval of £611m at 90%. This Approval Set the Aircraft Build Standard, Definition of in-Service Date, Key System Requirements and Aircraft Numbers.

## 5b. Cost of the Assessment Phase

| £m (Outturn Prices)       | Assessment Phase Cost | Proportion of Total Estimated Procurement Expenditure |

| Approved Cost at Initial Gate | 75                        | 14%                                                       |
