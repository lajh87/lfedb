Integrated Project Team Responsible:

THEATRE AND FORMATION COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS (TFCS)

Single Point of Accountability for project capability:

Director Equipment Capability (Command, Control & Information Infrastructure)

# SECTION 1: ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT

Falcon will provide a tactical formation level secure communications system for the UK and the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) and will replace the current communications systems Ptarmigan, Euromux and the Royal Air Force Transportable Telecommunications System.

Falcon will enable High Readiness Force (Land) (HRF(L)) units to be deployed rapidly to areas of crisis, allowing the UK to remain a pivotal member of the ARRC. It will provide the comprehensive and effective communications systems that are needed at all levels of command and will operate in conjunction with systems such as Bowman, Cormorant, Skynet 5 and with allies’ communications and information systems. It will not duplicate the capability of existing systems, but will be the high capacity system that binds together tactical communications in a theatre of operation as an integral part of the plans for Network Enabled Capability (NEC). The system will be modular and upgradeable, incorporating much off the shelf technology that will ease management of obsolescence throughout its service life. Falcon will require significantly less manpower to operate and will help alleviate shortfalls in manning, particularly in the Royal Signals trade group.

# SECTION 2: THE ASSESSMENT PHASE

Note: Actual in service dates and costs are not set until projects reach the point in time when the main investment decision is made ie Main Gate approval. Until this point all costs and dates are outline assumptions solely for internal planning purposes. 2a. Description of the Assessment Phase

Increment A of the Falcon programme gained Initial Gate (IG) approval in July 2002, following an extended Concept Phase that considered two key options: buy off the shelf technology (Bowman and Cormorant); and buy new capability. It was concluded that a new capability was required.

Marconi Selenia and BAE Systems (now Insyte) were selected for the 15 month Assessment Phase (AP) contract and to compete for the Demonstration and Manufacture (D&M) Phase prime contract for Increment
# A. The AP contracts concentrated on reducing the risk in the proposals for the D&M phase, including demonstration of components and subsystems to achieve an acceptable, affordable, low risk

solution. In addition, Whole Life Cost estimates were refined. Bidders’ proposals for the D&M phase were submitted on 31 March 2004.

The procurement strategy endorsed at IG comprised four increments:
Increment A provided for

HRF(L) and the ARRC; Increment B for UK divisions and brigades under armour; Increment C for RAF deployed operational bases; and Increment D for littoral warfare and deep support, including higher mobility. Increment D remains an unfunded aspiration.

During the later stages of the AP in 2004/2005, a savings option removed funding from the first two years of the D&M phase, resulting in a review of the incremental procurement strategy. Two options were considered. The first was for a single programme that effectively would have combined all three funded increments. This would have necessitated the project returning to pre-IG status and delayed the In Service Date by up to 4 years. This option was adopted as the planning assumption and reflected in MPR 2005. The second option was for the delivery of “early capability” that would provide for one medium scale deployment by 2010. It would utilise the savings option funding profile and exploit the existing contractor bids for Increment A. This option was explored and found to be viable.

In July 2005, approval was given to the further in-depth exploration of the second option and the selection of BAE Systems Insyte as the preferred bidder for Falcon Increment A. A programme was developed in conjunction with the preferred bidder that was affordable within the available funding.
