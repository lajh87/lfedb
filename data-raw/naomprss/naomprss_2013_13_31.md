# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1 The Requirement

A400M is planned to provide tactical and strategic mobility to all three Services. The required capabilities include: operations from airfields and semi-prepared rough landing areas in extreme climates and all weather conditions by day and night; carrying a variety of equipment including vehicles and troops over extended ranges; air dropping paratroops and equipment; and being unloaded with the minimum of ground handling equipment. The 1998 Strategic Defence Review confirmed a requirement for an airlift capability to move large single items such as attack helicopters and some Royal Engineers' equipment and concluded that this would be met, in the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century by Future Transport Aircraft. The A400M was selected to meet this requirement. It will replace the remaining Hercules C-130K fleet.

A400M is a collaborative programme involving seven European nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg, Spain, Turkey and United Kingdom). The design phase is nearing completion and manufacture activities have commenced. Delivery of the first UK aircraft to the Royal Air Force is expected in 2014.

## A.2 The Assessment Phase

The Government announced in December 1994 that it would replace its aging C-130K Hercules fleet, in part by procuring 25 C-130J's from Lockheed Martin and in addition, subject to certain conditions, by re-joining the next phase of the collaborative Future Large Aircraft programme (now known as A400M). The Future Large Aircraft 'Initial Gate' approval was achieved in July 1997 and in the same year the solution assumed for costing purposes was changed to an initial lease of four C-17 and subsequent procurement of 25 Future Large Aircraft. A Request For Proposals was issued to Airbus in September 1997 on behalf of the seven Future Large Aircraft nations (Belgium,

France Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey and UK). Subsequently, in July 1998, four nations (Belgium, France, Spain and UK) issued a
"competitive Request For Proposals" for a Future Transport Aircraft to Airbus Military (A400M), Boeing (C-17) and Lockheed Martin (C-130J).

Proposals were received on 29 January 1999 and parallel national and international assessments were undertaken. These covered Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisal, technical and commercial compliance, risk assessment, and an appraisal of the international dimensions. This work also led to parallel negotiations and clarification with the three bidders. At the direction of the Equipment Approvals Committee in December 1999, additional work was undertaken to inform the Main Gate submission. On 16 May 2000 the Government announced the decision to procure 25 A400M aircraft to meet the Future Transport Aircraft requirement.

## A.3 Project History

On 18 May 2000 the Investment Approvals Board approved the acquisition of 25 A400M aircraft with an In Service Date of December 2009. Following the submission of a Review Note, on 8 May 2003 the Investment Approvals Board revised the In Service Date to December 2011 and defined it as being the delivery of the seventh UK A400M aircraft. This change was necessary due to delays in the German Parliamentary approvals process which had prevented signature of the multinational contract; approval was finally granted on 21 May and, on 27 May 2003, the A400M Development and Production Phase contract (including the UK order for 25 aircraft) was signed by OCCAR on behalf of the six partner nations.

On 27 May 2006 the Investment Approvals Board granted Initial Gate approval and the A400M In Service Support Assessment Phase commenced.

On 26 June 2008 the first complete A400M aircraft was rolled out from the Airbus Military Final Assembly Line facility in Seville.

<tr>
<th>On 25 September 2008 Airbus announced a delay to the first flight of the A400M prototype aircraft and, on 25 November, announced that it could further slip until the "second half" of 2009. On 27 November, Airbus Military briefed the A400M Programme Board (the senior multinational governance body) on its progress with reassessing the aircraft delivery schedule. On 17 December 2008 the first flight of the A400M Flying Test Bed (an adapted C-130 aircraft) to undertake testing of the specially designed TP-400 turbo prop engine developed for A400M took place in Cambridge. On 19 December 2008, Airbus Military sent a revised production schedule to OCCAR and, on 9 January 2009, Airbus Military proposed a
"new approach" to the A400M programme and sought negotiations with partner nations. On 12 March 2009 a meeting of A400M partner nation defence ministers (at which the UK was represented by the Secretary of State) agreed to a
"standstill agreement" with Airbus Military. This enabled discussions about options and possible outcomes for the A400M programme to take place whilst the rights of all parties under the original contract were protected. A period of intensive negotiation, combined with a thorough review of all aspects of the programme, then followed. On 11 December 2009 the first flight of MSN001 (the first A400M prototype aircraft) took place in Seville. On 12 March 2010 the Investment Approvals Board reapproved the UK A400M programme with a revised In Service Date of 2015. On 29 March 2010 in a Written Ministerial Statement the Secretary of State informed Parliament that agreement had been reached between A400M partner nations and Airbus Military on the future of the programme. Heads of Terms had been agreed that would form the basis for the negotiation of an amended contract (including the decision to amend the UK order from 25 to 22 aircraft). On 31 March 2010 the Heads of Terms were signed on behalf of partner nations by OCCAR with Airbus Military. On 8 April 2010 the first flight of MSN002 (the second prototype aircraft) took place in Seville, followed on 9 July 2010 by the first flight of MSN003 (the third prototype), also in Seville. On 19 October 2010 the Strategic Defence and Security Review announcement stated that A400M would be a key element of the RAF future air transport fleet. It also announced the bringing forward of the Hercules C-130J Out of Service Date from 2030 to 2022. On 5 November 2010 the substantive contract amendment (which included revised aircraft production and delivery schedules) was agreed by partner nations' representatives and sent for national staffing and approval prior to signature. The UK had already achieved reapproval in March. On 20 December 2010 the first flight of MSN004 (fourth prototype aircraft) took place in Seville. On 7 April 2011 the amended Development and Production Phase contract was signed by OCCAR (on behalf of partner nations) with Airbus Military. This included the revised UK order of 22 aircraft. Investigation work into the causes of engine problems encountered in June 2011 during flight trials have concluded and solutions have been developed. Although this caused some disruption to the flight trials programme, this is not expected to have any significant impact on the aircraft production schedule. The first flight of MSN006 (the fifth and final prototype aircraft) took place on 20 December 2011 in Seville. Although the A400M is a military transport aircraft, its design will be predominantly civil certified with additional military certification as necessary. Following evaluation of evidence produced by the multinational flight trials programme, the European Aviation Safety Agency granted a restricted Type Certificate to A400M on 30 April 2012.</th>

## A.4 In-year Progress

The UK A400M training service achieved Main Gate approval in July 2012. It will now be reported as a separate increment to the main A400M programme and be measured against its own Main Gate approval.

Consequently the original Main Gate approval which, in addition to aircraft acquisition included elements of initial training and initial in service support, no longer represents an accurate baseline. As a result, the constituent elements of the original A400M platform Main Gate approval (achieved in

2000\) have been separated out and the A400M “Budgeted For” and
“Highest Approved” figures

(section B2 and B3, respectively) have been adjusted to reflect this change. Although the overall Demonstration and Manufacture forecast figure being reported in section B3 has come down, previously validated variations which remain within the scope of the original platform (aircraft acquisition) Main Gate approval will continue to be reported against this element of the programme, so that a consistent measure of project performance against the initial baseline is maintained.

Additionally, in anticipation of the achievement of UK A400M in service support Main Gate approval later this year, these elements of the original Main Gate approval have also been extracted.

At the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2012 the Prime Minister announced that an order for the first UK A400M full flight simulator had been agreed.

On 4 March 2013 Minister (Defence, Equipment, Support and Technology) announced that two further contracts relating to the A400M programme had been placed. The Training Service Support Contract will provide a specialist training school for personnel who will operate, support and maintain the A400M. A separate contract for the development, manufacture and installation of modifications required to operate the large aircraft infrared countermeasures defensive aids system when flying in hostile environments has also been let.

Following the conclusion of all of the required flight trials activity, the European Aviation Safety Agency granted a full Type Certificate to A400M on 13 March 2013.

## A.5 Capability Risks

Not proceeding with this capability would significantly reduce the UK's tactical air transport capability due to having to rely solely on C-130J aircraft to provide support to operations after the C-130K Out of Service Date in 2013. Furthermore, not proceeding would mean that the UK will not have any tactical air transport capability after 2022, (the revised Out of Service Date for the C130J declared in the Strategic Defence and Security Review) and less than the planned for

Strategic lift capability, as it would be dependant solely on the current fleet of eight C-17 aircraft.

The achievement of Type Certificate has significantly derisked the programme, and is another major step towards achieving a deliverable aircraft. Future capability risks include the ongoing development of military functionality, the delivery of an appropriate support solution and the provision of trained crews to match aircraft deliveries. These risks are well understood and work is ongoing to undertake effective mitigation activity.

As a result of the UK A400M training service achieving Main Gate approval in July 2012 and now being reported as a separate increment, and in anticipation of achievement of Main Gate approval for UK A400M in service support later this year, the "Actual cost boundaries" and
"Budgeted for cost" of the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase (sections B2 and B3) have been revised from previous Project Summary Sheets. Previously reported variations against the training and in service support elements of the original Main Gate approval have been removed as these were forecast figures rather than actual commitments or expenditure; any future variations will be reported against the relevant Main Gate approval. The remaining variations listed at section B3.1.1 relate to the main aircraft acquisition programme. The Department is currently seeking approval funding for the Export Levy Facility. This will ensure that the A400M programme remains within its revised approval limits.
