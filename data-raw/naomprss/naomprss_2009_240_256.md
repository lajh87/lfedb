# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. the Requirement Typhoon

Typhoon, Formerly Known as Eurofighter, is an Agile Multi-Role Combat Aircraft. Originally Designed Primarily, but not Exclusively, for Air Superiority the Aircraft is also Capable of Delivering a Precision Ground Attack Capability. Typhoon Has the Flexibility to Respond to the Uncertain Demands of the Current Strategic Environment and is Progressively Replacing the Tornado F3 and Jaguar Aircraft.

The Aircraft is Being Developed, Produced and Supported in a Collaborative Project with Germany, Italy and Spain. the Project is Managed on Behalf of the Four Partner Nations by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency. the Contract for the First Tranche of 148 Aircraft, of which 55 are for the UK, Was Signed in September 1998. the Contract for the Second Tranche Comprising 236 Aircraft, 89 of which are for the UK, Was Placed in December 2004. the Estimated Current Cost of Typhoon Was Classified in MPR05 and Remains so in MPR09, in Order to Protect the UK’s Ability to Negotiate for the Third Tranche. This Classification Remains in Place While the Tranche 3 Negotiations are Ongoing.

Typhoon Future Capability Programme

The Typhoon Future Capability Programme will Provide Enhancements to the Typhoon Aircraft, both in the Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface Roles, to Sustain the RAF’s Typhoon Fleet’s Multi-Role Capabilities.

The First Phase of the Future Capability Programme, under a Contract Signed in March 2007, will Integrate Paveway IV and the Litening III Laser Designator Pod Onto Tranche 2 Aircraft from 2012 as Well as Interoperability Upgrades without which Those Aircraft will be Neither Compliant with New Civil Airspace Regulations nor Interoperable with Key Coalition Allies. It will also Provide the Human Machine Interface for Multi-Role Operations, Allowing Typhoon to Fulfil Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface Operations with the Current, Planned and Projected Weapons.

Subsequent Phases of the Future Capability Programme are under Consideration in Parallel with Negotiations on the Third Tranche Purchase of Typhoon.

## A.2. the Assessment Phase Typhoon

Pre-Development, which Commenced with the Approval of the Feasibility Study in 1984, Comprised a Number of Activities. Following Early Concept Studies, and Various Efforts at Establishing a Collaborative Programme, There Were Two Key Typhoon Demonstration Activities Completed by the UK Before Development: The Experimental Aircraft Programme, an Airframe Programme Primarily Aimed at Proving the Feasibility of the Typhoon Unstable Flight Control Concepts, and the XG40 Engine Demonstrator Programme at Rolls Royce. the Results of These Demonstrators and their Associated Studies, Together with the Results of Similar Work Within the Other Nations Were Harmonised in a Definition, Refinement and Risk Reduction Phase that Ran from the End of 1985 when Four Nations Signed the Initial Memorandum of Understanding, until 1988 when the Development Contract Was Signed.

Typhoon Future Capability Programme

The Approval Process for Typhoon Tranche 2 Noted the Intention to Develop the Capability of the Aircraft Through Life and Envisaged an Incremental Route to the Acquisition of Future Capability Enhancements. the Assessment Phase Found Technology and Integration Were not a Major Challenge and that Risks Mostly Pertained to the Commercial and Industrial Aspects of the Programme. These Have Been Addressed and the MOD Approvals Process for the Project Was Accelerated to Combine Initial Gate, Including the Cost Already Incurred During the Assessment Phase, and Main Gate in Order to Maximise Efficiency Across the Four Partner Nations.

## A.3. Progress

Typhoon Has Been in Service with the RAF Since 2003 and Commenced Operational Duties for the First Time in June 2007 when it Assumed Quick Reaction Alert Responsibility for Defence of UK Airspace (Jointly with Tornado F3 on Rotation until April 2008). Deployable Air Defence Operational Status Was Achieved on 1 January 2008, which Enables Typhoon to Deploy Worldwide on Air-to-Air Missions. Typhoon Was Declared to NATO in the Deployable Air Defence – Advanced Role on 1 April 2008.

The Existing Advanced Air-to-Air Missile Capability on Tranche 1 Aircraft Has Been Complemented by the Integration of an Initial Precision Air-to-Surface Capability, which Was Declared Combat Ready by the RAF in July 2008. This Air-to-Surface Capability Enabled Declaration of Multi-Role Status and is in Advance of a more Comprehensive Air-to-Surface Package Through the Typhoon Future Capability Programme for Tranche 2 Aircraft.

Initial Deliveries of Tranche 2 Aircraft Commenced in October 2008. Negotiations are Continuing with Industry and Nations on Procurement of the Third Tranche of the Typhoon Aircraft. the Typhoon

Availability Service Contract with BAE Systems Was Signed in March 2009, which is Part of the Strategy to Transform Support Arrangements Through Partnering with UK Industry.

## A.4. Capability Risks

Typhoon is Intended to be the Cornerstone of UK Air Defence and the Aircraft will be Pivotal to the Delivery of Standing Home Commitments. Having Replaced Jaguar in the Ground Attack Role and with Future Reductions in Other Aircraft Types Planned, Loss of Typhoon Would Reduce the UK’s Ground-Attack Capability.

<th Colspan="5">typhoon’s Partnered Support Strategy Was Originally Approved in 2000. Its Principles Were Reinforced by the Results of a 2004 Support Review. the Partnered Support Strategy – Referred to as Typhoon Future Support - will be Delivered Through the Letting of Long-Term Contracts Against Five Areas of Support: For the Typhoon Availability Service on BAE Systems; for the Propulsion Availability Service on Rolls-Royce; for Avionics via the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency; and for International Technical Support Services, also via the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency. Valuable Experience Has Already Been Gained Through the Letting of Incremental Contracts to Transform Typhoon Support, the First of which Was the Initial Phase of the Engine Availability Contract with Rolls-Royce in 2005.</Th>

The Equipment Required to Generate, Verify and Validate Mission Dependent Data for Elements of the Weapons System Lags Aircraft Development by Up to 2 Years and is Currently not Fit for Purpose. Therefore, Mission Dependent Data Production is Reliant on Interim Industry Equipment which Does not Permit Validation or Verification Testing of this Data to MOD Quality Assurance Standards until January 2010 at the Earliest. Mitigations are in Place to Manage this Risk Against Typhoon’s Tasks over the Next 3 Years, but this Area will Require Further Investment as Typhoon’s Tasks Grow in Accordance with Extant Defence Planning Assumptions.
