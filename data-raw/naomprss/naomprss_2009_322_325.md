• Pre Main Investment Decision - Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability

# A. Section A: The Project

## A.1. The Requirement

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability programme will provide afloat logistic support to UK and allied maritime task groups at sea and their amphibious components operating ashore. Although not strictly a one-for-one replacement programme, new vessels will incrementally replace much of the existing Royal Fleet Auxiliary flotilla, as ships enter and leave service respectively.

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability capability is designed to support three distinct types of maritime task group: Carrier Strike, Littoral Manoeuvre and Maritime Security. The demands of each differ significantly, but are all composed of three common elements:

Bulk Consumables - fuel and potable water which are transferred by hose.

Non-bulk consumables - Food, ammunition and general stores. Solid cargo which is transferred in unit loads, either ship-ship or ship-shore.

Forward Aviation Support - The provision of helicopter basing and operating facilities to accommodate some of the task group’s aircraft or to provide operational flexibility during a campaign.

An early decision was taken to base the system solution on three classes of ship:

Fleet Tanker - Bulk consumables and Forward Aviation Support for all task groups. Limited non-bulk consumables capacity to support the small Maritime Security groups.

Fleet Solid Support Ship - Non-bulk consumables and Forward Aviation Support, optimised for the Carrier Strike group.

Joint Sea-Based Logistics Ship - Non-bulk consumables and Forward Aviation Support, optimised for the Littoral Manoeuvre group.

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability capability will be in service until around 2047 and as such the solution will be designed to accommodate the requirements of current and known future force structures, including, Type 45, the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers, Joint Strike Fighter and Future Surface Combatant.

The capability to be provided is essential to the evolving logistic support needs of the Royal Navy. The proposed procurement profile of Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability ships has been matched to this need, the initial focus being on the double-hulled Fleet Tankers which are required in order to comply with International Maritime environmental standards.

## A.2. The Assessment Phase

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability programme received formal approval to enter its Assessment Phase in July 2005 based on an Alliance strategy.

Between March and September 2007, the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability procurement strategy was reviewed to reflect the need to procure the Fleet Tanker element of the programme in order to comply with International Maritime legislation. The Alliance strategy and the competition to choose an Integrator was terminated in May 2007. In December 2007, Ministerial approval was given for a new strategy based on a ‘Competitive and Adaptive’ approach and an open competition was launched for the design and build of up to six Fleet Tankers. In addition to this approval, Minister approved the designation and delegation of the Heavy Replenishment at Sea project as a separate Category D project. Fleet Solid Support and Joint Sea Based Logistics ships will now form a separate strategy to be considered with wider UK industrial interests.

The approved budget for the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability Assessment Phase is £44m and the current forecast for the Assessment Phase, including early design and requirement work for Fleet Solid Support and Joint Sea Based Logistics vessels \\\ (Fleet

## A.3. Progress

In May 2008, the Secretary of State for Defence announced that four bidders had been down selected for the next stage of the competition. They were Navantia (Spain); Fincantieri (Italy), Hyundai Heavy Industries (Republic of Korea) and a consortium led by BVT (UK) with BMT and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (Republic of Korea). Initial bids were received.

Between May and December 2008 the Department carried out an examination of its equipment programme. As a result of this examination the Secretary of State for Defence announced that there was scope for considering alternative approaches for the Military Reach and Sustainability programme likely to involve the deferral of the Fleet Tanker element. The competition was formally closed in March 2009. A review of the requirements and procurement strategy is underway.

## A.4. Capability Risks

The Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability programme will deliver future Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, replacing the current capability, to support the future Royal Navy. Without the support of these ships, the ability of the Royal Navy to carry out global operations would be severely restricted. Double hulled naval tankers are required as soon as is practicable to comply with international maritime legislation; the Royal Fleet Auxiliary currently operates two double hulled tankers and six single hulled tankers under exemption from legislation. All Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships are maintained to UK regulatory and classifications standards; should this certification be withdrawn for single hulled tankers, their operation would cease leading to operational limitations. Foreign nations may decide to deny port access for single hulled tankers as a result of an environmental incident. Programming for operations takes account of environmental restrictions as well as limitations on ships due to their material state; some of the older ships being unable to operate in colder climates due to their hulls being made of ‘brittle steel’. These ships will be replaced as part of this programme.
