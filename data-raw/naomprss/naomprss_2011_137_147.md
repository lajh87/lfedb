1.  Section A: The Project

1.  The Requirement

The Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme will update 30 Merlin Mk1 aircraft to overcome existing and forecast obsolescence within the Weapon System Avionics to ensure sustainment of the required capability until the planned Out of Service Date (2029). The converted aircraft will be known as the Merlin Mk2.

1.  The Assessment Phase

Following approval of the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme Initial Gate Business Case, the

Assessment Phase contract was placed in June 2003. The main Assessment Phase activities comprised:

-   Analysis of the User Requirements and development of a consolidated set of system requirements in the form of a Systems Requirement Document.

-   Production of System and Sub-System design requirements, and seeking initial costed proposals from potential suppliers.

-   Conducting trade-off studies to identify the best value solution where options exist.

-   Developing a coherent plan for Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme, aligned to other existing and planned Merlin programmes.

-   Undertaking Integrated Test, Evaluation and Acceptance planning.

-   Identification of the risks to the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme, and the identification and implementation of mitigation action to reduce the impact to an acceptable level.

-   Produce documentation and costed proposals for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase.

-   Undertaking initial Integrated Logistic Support activities to define a solution compliant with the evolving Support Solution Envelope.

Future Rotorcraft Capability Review

During the Assessment Phase, MOD embarked on a review of all future rotorcraft requirements under the title of the Future Rotorcraft Capability review. The Demonstration & Manufacture Proposal that had been provided by Industry and the associated business case were produced before the impact of the Future Rotorcraft Capability review was known. The Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme was reviewed as part of the wider Future Rotorcraft Capability programme. The Future Rotorcraft Capability programme determined that the balance of financial investment over the first four years of the Equipment Programme between Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme and Lynx Wildcat should be on a 50/50, 30/70, 30/70, 30/70 basis respectively.

To allow Industry to continue critical path activity and to support the reprogramming activities resulting from Future Rotorcraft Capability, the Future Rotorcraft Capability programme provided Transition Phase funding (six months) to the Merlin Integrated Project Team for an extension to the Assessment Phase contract.

A further transition phase (six months) was required to again sustain programme momentum, align it with wider Future Rotorcraft Capability requirements and maintain programme viability during the approvals process.

1.  Progress

Successful achievement of first flight ahead of schedule in November 2010. The first two production aircraft are in the factory at Yeovil (aircraft 5 & 6) and conversion is underway. Initial Provisioning (IP) spares have now been contracted. Programme remains on schedule.

1.  Capability Risks

The Merlin Mk1 is responsible for delivering protection to the Royal Navy’s fleet from sub-surface threats. It also provides a significant contribution to their overall situational awareness both above and below the water. The programme is designed to sustain the capability out to the current Out of Service Date. Without this programme the ability to detect sub-surface threats would be reduced; or if the obsolescence issues were addressed through an alternate strategy (piecemeal approach) lead to a large increase in Through-Life costs.

<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td>The support strategy of the Merlin Mk2 will be the same as that employed for the current UK Merlin (Mk1 &amp; Mk3), namely Integrated Merlin Operational Support contract. Integrated Merlin Operational Support is a whole life aircraft availability contract that is priced by flying hours within a defined band with incentives to generate fit-for-purpose aircraft to the Front Line. There are five key elements of the Integrated Merlin Operational Support Service:
Service Management Aircraft Provision Materiel Support Technical Support Training It is a 25 year contract (commenced in 2006) and priced in five year tranches. The five years to March 2011 has an approval of £M (including Indirect RDEL). The second five year pricing period commencing April 2011 has an approval of £M (including Indirect RDEL). The contract supports the current fleet of 38 Merlin MK1 (reducing to 30 MK2 by the end of this pricing period), 22 Merlin MK3 and 6 Merlin MK3a. It also supports the Merlin MK1 Training System. The Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme will deliver the necessary changes and updates to ensure that Integrated Merlin Operational Support can continue to support Merlin MK2. This includes new Initial Provisioning Spares, new Aircraft Specialist Support Equipment and associated updates to technical publications. At Main Gate for Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme it was identified that during the transition from MK1 to MK2 there would be a potential £45M cost for provision of spares. This was afforded through savings arising during the transition due to reductions in MK1 activity and procured through the support solution. However, savings were subsequently taken and the affordability of the spares procurement was in doubt:
some £12M remained in the budget for aircraft and training sytems spares. In parallel savings were identified in the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme programme of some £29M (due to the termination of the Helicopter Electro-mechanical Actuation Technology element of the programme and reallocation of funding for Aircraft Specialist Support Equipment). This allowed the required spares provision of a total of
£41M, some £4M below the original estimate. Additionally following a risk review and based on lessons learned from other programmes, it was determined that procurement of the spares through the Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme contract was lower risk since it ensured that the spares and aircraft build standards were aligned.</td>
