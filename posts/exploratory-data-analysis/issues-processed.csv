1,"naomprss_2006_105_110.md","## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events","Delay in contract initiation due to Departmental funding constraints.","The cause of this issue was the lack of available funding within the Department, which delayed the contract initiation and limited it to the placement of the main Weapon, support and Harrier GR9 Integration Contracts.","This issue has a time impact. The delay in contract initiation has resulted in a pro-rata slip to the Main Gate In Service Date estimates. However, efforts are being made to recover this slip."
2,"naomprss_2006_105_110.md","## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events","Uncertainty regarding the integration of Tornado and Typhoon aircraft.","The cause of this issue is not clearly stated in the text, but it seems to be related to the planning and decision-making process.","This issue also has a time impact. A further submission will be made once the way forward for Tornado and Typhoon integration becomes clear, which implies a delay in the overall project timeline."
3,"naomprss_2006_105_110.md","## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events","Addition of LASER capability to the weapon.","The cause of this issue is the decision to enhance the weapon's capabilities, which was mutually beneficial to RSL and MOD.","This issue has a positive impact on performance.

1,"naomprss_2006_105_110.md","## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase","The Assessment Phase took longer than expected.","The process of releasing Invitations to Tender to six companies, receiving six formal tenders, conducting a two-stage Assessment Phase, and conducting a Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisal (COEIA) and a technical and commercial assessment of the tenders by the PGB IPT and its specialist stakeholders took a significant amount of time.","This delay could have potentially increased the cost of the project and delayed its completion. This is a time and cost issue."
2,"naomprss_2006_105_110.md","## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase","The selection process may have been biased.","The text does not provide information on how the preferred bidder was selected. It is unclear whether the process was fair and transparent, and whether all bids were evaluated on the same criteria.","This could potentially lead to legal challenges from the companies that were not selected, which could further delay the project and increase costs.

1,"naomprss_2006_117_126.md","## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events","The project bypassed the Assessment Phase and moved directly to the main investment decision.","The project passed Main Gate in November 2001 which approved an international competitive conventional procurement in place of an aborted PFI.","This could have led to potential risks and issues not being identified and addressed early in the project. This could impact the project's time and cost due to unforeseen complications down the line."
2,"naomprss_2006_117_126.md","## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events","The Investments Approvals Board directed the Project Team to procure the minimum contracted number of vehicles (5165) and conduct an Investment Appraisal.","This was likely due to budget constraints or a desire to ensure value for money.","This could have led to delays in the project timeline as the Investment Appraisal would take additional time to complete. However, it could also lead to cost savings if the appraisal found that retaining elements of the existing fleet offered better value for money."
3,"naomprss_2006_117_126.md","## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events","A Departmental Review resulted in a reduction in the number of Recovery Vehicles and other peripherals.","The review, which commenced in November 2005, aimed at further reducing cost and understanding risk.","This could have led to cost savings, but it could also have impacted the project's performance if the reduced number of vehicles and peripherals compromised the project's objectives."
4,"naomprss_2006_117_126.md","## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events","The in-service date (ISD) is in 2 stages – 161 Cargo Vehicles in July 2007 and 8 Recovery Vehicles plus 2 Recovery Trailers in February 2008.","This could be due to production schedules, budget constraints, or other logistical considerations.","This could impact the project's timeline and potentially its cost, depending on whether these staggered delivery dates were factored into the original project plan."
1,"naomprss_2006_117_126.md","## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase","No Assessment Phase","The SV programme originated from the FCV and FWRV projects, which were launched as potential PFI programmes. The decision was made to bypass the Assessment Phase due to the maturity of the technologies and the department's detailed knowledge of the commercial vehicle sector, which was acquired during the PFI phase of the project.","This could potentially lead to issues in the future if unforeseen problems arise that would have been identified during an Assessment Phase. This can impact both time and cost, as it may require additional resources to resolve these issues."
2,"naomprss_2006_117_126.md","## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase","Initial Gate Business Case was not submitted for approval","The Initial Gate Business Case did not demonstrate value for money and was therefore not submitted for approval.","This could potentially delay the project and increase costs, as further work was requested to identify areas for further innovation and to develop a 'smart' Public Sector Comparator (PSC). This impacts both time and cost."
3,"naomprss_2006_117_126.md","## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase","Change in procurement strategy","Confidence in PFI procurement was unlikely to improve, leading to the decision to replace the PFI procurement strategy with a conventional strategy and hold a fresh competition.","This could potentially lead to delays and increased costs, as it requires a new competition to be held and a new procurement strategy to be developed and implemented. This impacts both time and cost."
4,"naomprss_2006_117_126.md","## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase","Merging of FCV and FWRV programmes","The decision was made to merge the FCV and FWRV programmes into a single procurement in order to proceed directly to the main investment decision.","This could potentially lead to efficiencies in terms of time and cost, as it eliminates the need for separate procurements. However, it could also lead to complications if the requirements of the two programmes are not fully aligned. This impacts performance, time, and cost."

6,"naomprss_2006_127_132.md","## 5a. Description of the Assessment Phase","The Main Gate Business Case was approved on 17 July 2002. The contract for Demonstration, Manufacture and Phase 1 Contractor Logistic Support was placed with Royal Ordnance PLC on 19 July 2002.","The approval of the business case and the selection of a contractor.","This marks the official start of the project, which could have impacts on time, cost, and performance."
1,"naomprss_2006_133_138.md","## 1a. Project description, progress and key future events","The project has experienced some delay and cost-growth due to the decision to fit Bowman during production build, rather than Clansman.","The decision to change the equipment from Clansman to Bowman during the production build phase of the project.","This issue has affected both the time and cost of the project. The delay in the project timeline has likely impacted the schedule for delivery and implementation of the vehicles. The cost-growth implies that the project budget has increased, which could impact the overall financial resources of the project or organization."
